You can add a plugin to the **Cloud service** as an **extension**. It can be done for Google Chrome, Opera, or Microsoft Edge browsers.

## Step 1. Creating extensions

1. To create an extension, you need an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Sing in to an existing account or create a new one.

2. Fork the plugin marketplace repository: <https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice.github.io>.

   You get a repository with the following address - *https\://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice.github.io*.

3. Build your own GitHub Pages site from this repository. Explore the official [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to learn how to do it.

4. Clone the fork to your local computer.

5. Add the plugin folder to *onlyoffice.github.io/sdkjs-plugins/content/* and push it to the remote repository.

6. Open the *onlyoffice.github.io/store/plugin-dev/extension/inject.js* file and assign the path to your plugin on GitHub Pages site to the **URL\_TO\_PLUGIN** variable:

   ```
   var URL_TO_PLUGIN = "https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/onlyoffice.github.io/sdkjs-plugins/content/helloworld/"
   ```

The *onlyoffice.github.io/store/plugin-dev/extension* folder is a new extension.

Please note that when adding an extension to [ONLYOFFICE App Directory](https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/app-directory), the **Title** and **Summary** are filled in automatically with the **name** and **description** parameters from the *manifest.json* file. You cannot change them later in the store.

## Step 2. Uploading extensions to the browser

After your extension is ready, upload it to the browser. Follow the instructions below for the browser you use.

* Google Chrome

* Microsoft Edge
