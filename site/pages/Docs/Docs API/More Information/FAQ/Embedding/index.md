* How to embed a document to a web site?

  There are three main appearances of the editors, optimized for different use:

  * **desktop**, which is optimized for the display in desktop computer browsers;
  * **mobile**, which is optimized for the display in mobile device browsers;
  * **embedded**, which is optimized for the embedding the documents into a website page.

  You can embed the document with any appearance to your webpage, but it is more logical to use the specific **embedded** display type with only main controls for the editors displayed for the document within a website page.

  That is why the *type* should be set to **embedded** and the configuration file will look like this:

  ```
  var docEditor = new DocsAPI.DocEditor("placeholder", {
      "type": "embedded",
      ...
  });
  ```

  Further information about the display type can be found [at this page](/editors/config#type).

- How to change the behavior of the buttons in the embedded mode?

  The embedded mode allows to display the document with only three control buttons: **Download**, **Share** and **Embed**. You can change the behavior of these buttons the following way:

  * *editorConfig.embedded.embedUrl* is the absolute URL to the document with the *type* parameter set to **embedded** in the configuration, which can be used by other users to embed it into their own website page.
  * *editorConfig.embedded.saveUrl* is the absolute URL to the document with the *document.permission.download* parameter set to **true**, which can be saved by other users to their own computer in the *DOCX*, *PPTX* or *XLSX* format depending on the file type.
  * *editorConfig.embedded.shareUrl* is the absolute URL to the document which can be used by other users to share it with others.

  ```
  var docEditor = new DocsAPI.DocEditor("placeholder", {
      "editorConfig": {
          "embedded": {
              "embedUrl": "https://example.com/embedded?doc=exampledocument1.docx",
              "saveUrl": "https://example.com/download?doc=exampledocument1.docx",
              "shareUrl": "https://example.com/view?doc=exampledocument1.docx",
              ...
          },
          ...
      },
      ...
  });
  ```

  Where the **example.com** is the name of the server where **document manager** and **document storage service** are installed. See the [How it works](/editors/howitworks) section to find out more on ONLYOFFICE Docs service client-server interactions.

  To remove any of these buttons simply do not include the corresponding parameter into the configuration file.

  If you decide to hide the **Download** button (*editorConfig.embedded.saveUrl* parameter), please do not forget to also set the *document.permission.download* parameter in the document configuration to **false** to completely disable the possibility to download the file.

  Further information about the embedding parameters can be found [at this page](/editors/config/editor/embedded).
