The server stores all *callbackUrls* and chooses which one to use depending on the user who performed the action.

Since version 5.5, [callbackUrl](/editors/config/editor#callbackUrl) is selected depending on the *status* of the request. Starting from version 4.4 to version 5.5, *callbackUrl* is used from the last user who joined the co-editing. Prior to version 4.4, when co-editing, *callbackUrl* is used from the user who first opened the file for editing.

Since version 7.0, *callbackUrl* is used from the last tab of the same user. Prior to version 7.0, *callbackUrl* from the first user tab was used.

| *Status* **1**         | It is received every user connection to or disconnection from document co-editing. Their *callbackUrl* is used.Please note that the *status* **1** can be also received when the user is returned to the document with no changes after the Internet problems. This situation can be described as follows:- When the user opens a document, the *status* **1** is sent.
- If the Internet connection is lost and the user has not made any changes to the document, the *status* **4** is sent. An error is displayed on the screen and the document is opened in the viewer.
- Within 100 seconds, the Internet connection is restored, the user is reconnected to the document and the *status* **1** is sent again.
- Now the user can continue to edit the document. The *status* **2** or **4** will be received depending on whether the user made any changes to the document or not. |
| *Status* **2** (**3**) | It is received [10 seconds](/editors/save#savedelay) after the document is closed for editing with the identifier of the user who was the last to send the changes to the document editing service. The *callbackUrl* from the user who made the last changes to the file is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| *Status* **6** (**7**) | It is received when the force saving request is performed.The *callbackUrl* depends on *forcesavetype* parameter:- If *forcesavetype* parameter is set to **1**, the *callbackUrl* from the user who clicked the **Save** button is used.
- If *forcesavetype* parameter is set to **0** or **2**, the *callbackUrl* from the user who made the last changes to the file is used.
- If *forcesavetype* parameter is set to **3**, the *callbackUrl* from the user who clicked the **Submit** button is used.Starting from version 5.5 to version 6.1, the *callbackUrl* from the user who made the last changes to the file is always used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Response from the document storage service

The **document storage service** must return the following response, otherwise the **document editor** will display an error message:

```
{
    "error": 0
}
```

The **document manager** and **document storage service** are either included to ONLYOFFICE Workspace or must be implemented by the software integrators who use ONLYOFFICE Docs on their own server.
