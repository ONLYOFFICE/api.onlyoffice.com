When performing the HTTP requests from ONLYOFFICE Docs the *token* is added to the parameters to validate the data. When performing the HTTP requests to ONLYOFFICE Docs the *token* must be added to the parameters to validate the data.

Starting from version 5.2, it is possible to use the token in body parameters with **ONLYOFFICE Docs**. To enable it set the *services.CoAuthoring.token.inbox.inBody* and *services.CoAuthoring.token.outbox.inBody* in configuration file to **true**.

Starting from version 7.1, these parameters are deprecated. Now the incoming requests use the token in body if it exists. Otherwise, the header token is taken. To specify what is used next to validate the data, [services.CoAuthoring.server.tokenRequiredParams](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-configuring.aspx#services-CoAuthoring-server-tokenRequiredParams) must be added to the *local.json* configuration file. If it is **true**, only the token data is used. Otherwise, the opened request part is merged with the token data.

The outgoing requests use both the token in body and token in header. They can be different. For example, the information about version history can be removed from the header token because of the size limit of the token in header.

Token in body is used for POST requests only. For the GET requests [token in header](/editors/signature/request) is used.

Parameters

| Parameter                                | Description                                                                                                                                                            | Type    | Example |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| services.CoAuthoring.token.inbox.inBody  | Specifies the enabling the token validation in the request body to the **document command service**, **document conversion service** and **document builder service**. | boolean | false   |
| services.CoAuthoring.token.outbox.inBody | Specifies the enabling the token generation for the request body by **document editing service** to **document storage service**.                                      | boolean | false   |

The *payload* for the JSON Web Token contains the request body parameters.

## Incoming request

* **Request to receive the status of the edited document**

  Validation is performed for incoming requests with the commands from the **document storage service** to the [document command service](/editors/command).

  Sample parameters of request to receive the status of the edited document

  ```
  {
      "c": "info",
      "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7"
  }
  ```

  These parameters must be encoded into the token so that the request looked like this:

  Sample of request to receive the status of the edited document

  ```
  POST coauthoring/CommandService.ashx HTTP/1.1
  Host: documentserver
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJjIjoiaW5mbyIsImtleSI6IktoaXJ6NnpUUGRmZDcifQ.r_6sThjFABsHMNHhkVdHDSz4jwkbXRQNYdvawkBGJgg"
  }
  ```

  As you can see there is no need to include the above parameters into the request body, as all of them are already encoded into the token and sent within it.

* **Request to convert the document**

  Validation is performed for incoming requests with the commands from the **document storage service** to the [document conversion service](/editors/conversionapi).
