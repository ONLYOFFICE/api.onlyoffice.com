For the interaction with the **document command service** the POST requests are used. The request parameters are entered in JSON format in the request body. The requests are sent to the https\://documentserver/coauthoring/CommandService.ashx address where the **documentserver** is the name of the server with the ONLYOFFICE Docs installed.

Starting from version 8.1, it is recommended to add the [shardkey](/editors/howitworks#shardkey) parameter to the URL *QueryString* with the *key* value in it. For example, *?shardkey=Khirz6zTPdfd7*. This allows you to load balance requests.

In **ONLYOFFICE Docs** prior to version 4.2 the GET request with the parameters in the *QueryString* were used.

See the available command types below to find more about them.
