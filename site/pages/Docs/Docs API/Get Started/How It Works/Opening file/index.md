The reference figure and the steps below explain the process of opening a document in ONLYOFFICE Docs.

![Opening File](/content/img/editor/opening.svg)

1. The user uses the **document manager** (found in his/her browser) to open the document for viewing or editing.

   The browser **document manager** receives the list of all documents available to the user from the **document storage service**.
2. The document identifier and the link to it at the **document storage service** are sent using the [JavaScript API](/editors/basic) to the **document editor**.
3. The **document editor** forms a request to the **document editing service** for document opening. The **document editor** uses the document identifier and its link received from the **document manager** (at step 2).
4. The **document editing service** downloads the document file from the **document storage service** using the ID and link provided. At this step the [conversion](/editors/conversion) of the file into Office Open XML format is also performed for the **document editor** better performance and formats compatibility.
5. When ready the **document editing service** transfers the document file to the browser-based **document editor**.
6. The **document editor** displays the document file and/or (in case the appropriate rights are provided) allows its editing.

After the editing is finished, the [document saving](/editors/save) process takes place.

## How this can be done in practice

1. Create an empty *html* file.
2. Add the *div* element as shown below.
   ```
   <div id="placeholder"></div>
   ```
3. Specify your ONLYOFFICE Docs link with the JavaScript API that will be used for your website.
   ```
   <script type="text/javascript" src="https://documentserver/web-apps/apps/api/documents/api.js"></script>
   ```
   Where the **documentserver** is the name of the server with the ONLYOFFICE Docs installed.
4. Add the script initializing the **Document Editor** for the *div* element with the configuration for the document you want to open. Be sure to add a [token](/editors/security) when using local links. Otherwise, an error will occur.
   ```
   new DocsAPI.DocEditor("placeholder", {
       "document": {
           "fileType": "docx",
           "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
           "title": "Example Document Title.docx",
           "url": "https://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"
       },
       "documentType": "word",
       "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkb2N1bWVudCI6eyJmaWxlVHlwZSI6ImRvY3giLCJrZXkiOiJLaGlyejZ6VFBkZmQ3IiwidGl0bGUiOiJFeGFtcGxlIERvY3VtZW50IFRpdGxlLmRvY3giLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tL3VybC10by1leGFtcGxlLWRvY3VtZW50LmRvY3gifSwiZG9jdW1lbnRUeXBlIjoid29yZCJ9.7IpEJxdOvBQ0kJ8l6ZegIV4tX5vsPbZZCDDVmcFROXc"
   });
   ```
   Where the **example.com** is the name of the server where **document manager** and **document storage service** are installed.
5. Open your *html* file in the browser.
