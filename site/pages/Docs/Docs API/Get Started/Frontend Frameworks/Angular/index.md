The ONLYOFFICE Docs Angular [component](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-editor-angular-workspace) integrates ONLYOFFICE Docs into [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) projects.

## Prerequisites

This procedure requires [Node.js (and npm)](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Creating the demo Angular application with ONLYOFFICE Docs editor

This procedure creates a [basic Angular application](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) and installs an ONLYOFFICE Docs editor in it.

1. Open a command line or command prompt and install the [Angular CLI Tool](https://angular.io/cli) package:

   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. Create a new Angular project named *onlyoffice-angular-demo*:

   ```
   ng new --defaults --skip-git onlyoffice-angular-demo
   ```

3. Go to the newly created directory:

   ```
   cd onlyoffice-angular-demo
   ```

4. Install ONLYOFFICE Docs Angular component from **npm** and save it to the *package.json* file with *--save*:

   ```
   npm install --save @onlyoffice/document-editor-angular
   ```

   You can also use the following **yarn** command:

   ```
   yarn add @onlyoffice/document-editor-angular
   ```

The following steps depend on the Angular version you use. To check the installed version, run the following command:

```
ng version
```

* Versions prior to 17.0.0
* Versions 17.0.0 and above

1. Open the *./src/app/app.module.ts* file in the *onlyoffice-angular-demo* project and import the **DocumentEditorModule**:

   ```
   import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
   import { DocumentEditorModule } from "@onlyoffice/document-editor-angular";
   import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
   import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";

   @NgModule({
       declarations: [
           AppComponent
       ],
       imports: [
           DocumentEditorModule,
           BrowserModule
       ],
       bootstrap: [AppComponent]
   })

   export class AppModule { }
    
   ```

2. Open the *./src/app/app.component.ts* file in the *onlyoffice-angular-demo* project and define options in your consuming component:

   ```
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { IConfig } from "@onlyoffice/document-editor-angular";

   @Component({
       selector: "app-root",
       templateUrl: "./app.component.html"
   })
   export class AppComponent {
       config: IConfig = {
           document: {
               "fileType": "docx",
               "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
               "title": "Example Document Title.docx",
               "url": "https://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"
           },
           documentType: "word",
           editorConfig: {
               "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/url-to-callback.ashx"
           },
       }

       onDocumentReady = () => {
           console.log("Document is loaded");
       };

       onLoadComponentError = (errorCode, errorDescription) => {
           switch(errorCode) {
               case -1: // Unknown error loading component
                   console.log(errorDescription);
                   break;

               case -2: // Error load DocsAPI from http://documentserver/
                   console.log(errorDescription);
                   break;

               case -3: // DocsAPI is not defined
                   console.log(errorDescription);
                   break;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace the following lines with your own data:

   * **"https\://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"** - replace with the URL to your file;
   * **"https\://example.com/url-to-callback.ashx"** - replace with your callback URL (this is required for the saving functionality to work).

   This TypeScript file will create the *AppComponent* component containing the ONLYOFFICE Docs editor configured with basic features.

3. In template, use the *document-editor* component with your options:

   ```
   <document-editor
       id="docxEditor"
       documentServerUrl="http://documentserver/"
       [config]="config"
       [events_onDocumentReady]="onDocumentReady"
       [onLoadComponentError]="onLoadComponentError"
   ></document-editor>
   ```

   Replace the **"http\://documentserver/"** line with the URL of your server.

1) Open the *./src/app/app.component.ts* file in the *onlyoffice-angular-demo* project and define options in your consuming component:

   Please note that starting from Angular v17.0.0, the *app.module.ts* file is not added to the new projects by default. You must specify *DocumentEditorModule* in the *imports* property of the *Component* decorator and set *standalone* to *true*.

   ```
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { IConfig } from "@onlyoffice/document-editor-angular";
   import { DocumentEditorModule } from "@onlyoffice/document-editor-angular";

   @Component({
       selector: "app-root",
       standalone: true,
       imports: [DocumentEditorModule],
       templateUrl: "./app.component.html"
   })
   export class AppComponent {
       config: IConfig = {
           document: {
               "fileType": "docx",
               "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
               "title": "Example Document Title.docx",
               "url": "https://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"
           },
           documentType: "word",
           editorConfig: {
               "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/url-to-callback.ashx"
           },
       }

       onDocumentReady = () => {
           console.log("Document is loaded");
       };

       onLoadComponentError = (errorCode, errorDescription) => {
           switch(errorCode) {
               case -1: // Unknown error loading component
                   console.log(errorDescription);
                   break;

               case -2: // Error load DocsAPI from http://documentserver/
                   console.log(errorDescription);
                   break;

               case -3: // DocsAPI is not defined
                   console.log(errorDescription);
                   break;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace the following lines with your own data:

   * **"https\://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"** - replace with the URL to your file;
   * **"https\://example.com/url-to-callback.ashx"** - replace with your callback URL (this is required for the saving functionality to work).

   This TypeScript file will create the *AppComponent* component containing the ONLYOFFICE Docs editor configured with basic features.

2) In template, use the *document-editor* component with your options:

   ```
   <document-editor
       id="docxEditor"
       documentServerUrl="http://documentserver/"
       [config]="config"
       [events_onDocumentReady]="onDocumentReady"
       [onLoadComponentError]="onLoadComponentError"
   ></document-editor>
   ```

   Replace the **"http\://documentserver/"** line with the URL of your server.

Test the application using the Node.js development server:

* To start the development server, navigate to the *onlyoffice-angular-demo* directory and run:

  ```
  npm run start
  ```

* To stop the development server, select on the command line or command prompt and press *Ctrl+C*.

## Deploying the demo Angular application

To deploy the application to a production environment, create the build-specific configuration options for Angular projects:

1. Create the *src/environments/* directory and configure the project to use these files by running the following command:

   ```
   ng generate environments
   ```

   The newly created directory contains the *environment.ts* base configuration file, which provides configuration for the default *production* environment. The default values can be overridden for the additional environments, such as *development* and *staging*, in target-specific configuration files.

   The base *environment.ts* file contains the default environment settings:

   ```
   export const environment = {
       production: false
   }
   ```

   The *build* command uses this as the build target when no environment is specified.

   You can add additional properties to the *environment* object, or as separate objects. For example, the default *apiUrl* variable is added to the default environment:

   ```
   export const environment = {
       production: true,
       apiUrl: "http://my-prod-url"
   };
   ```

   The target-specific configuration files, such as *environment.development.ts*, set default values for the *development* build target:

   ```
   export const environment = {
       production: true
   }
   ```

2. Import the original environment file in the *app.component.ts* component file to use the environment configurations you have defined:

   ```
   import { environment } from "./../environments/environment";
   ```

   This ensures that the *build* and *serve* commands can find the configurations for the specific build targets.

3. Add the *fileReplacements* parameter to the configuration for each build target of the *angular.json* configuration file. This parameter replaces any file in the TypeScript program with the target-specific file version and includes the target-specific code or variables in a build that targets a specific environment, such as *development* or *staging*.

   By default no files are replaced. But you can add file replacements for the specific build targets:

   ```
   "configurations": {
       "development": {
           "fileReplacements": [
               {
                   "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
                   "with": "src/environments/environment.development.ts"
               }
           ],
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

   This means that when you build your development configuration with *ng build --configuration development*, the *src/environments/environment.ts* file is replaced with the *src/environments/environment.development.ts* target-specific version of the file.

   You can add additional configurations. For example, to add a *staging* environment, copy the *src/environments/environment.ts* file with the *src/environments/environment.staging.ts* title, then add a *staging* configuration to *angular.json*:

   ```
   "configurations": {
       "production": { ... },
       "staging": {
           "fileReplacements": [
               {
                   "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
                   "with": "src/environments/environment.staging.ts"
               }
           ]
       }
   }
   ```

4. Configure the *serve* command to use the targeted build configuration by adding it to the *serve.configurations* section of *angular.json*:

   ```
   "serve": {
       "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
       "configurations": {
           "production": {
               "browserTarget": "document-editor-angular-workspace:build:production"
           },
           "development": {
               "browserTarget": "document-editor-angular-workspace:build:development"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

Now you can deploy the application to the created server:

1. Navigate to the *onlyoffice-angular-demo* directory and run:

   ```
   ng build
   ```

   The *dist* directory will be created with a production build of your app.

2. Copy the contents of the *dist/onlyoffice-angular-demo* directory to the root directory of the web server (to the *onlyoffice-angular-demo* folder).

The application will be deployed on the web server (*http\://localhost:3000* by default).
