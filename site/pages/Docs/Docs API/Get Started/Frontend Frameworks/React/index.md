The ONLYOFFICE Docs React [component](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-editor-react) integrates ONLYOFFICE Docs into [React](https://react.dev/) projects.

## Prerequisites

This procedure requires [Node.js (and npm)](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Creating the demo React application with ONLYOFFICE Docs editor

This procedure creates a [basic React application](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and installs an ONLYOFFICE Docs editor in it.

1. Create a new React project named *onlyoffice-react-demo* using the *Create React App* package:

   ```
   npx create-react-app onlyoffice-react-demo
   ```

2. Go to the newly created directory:

   ```
   cd onlyoffice-react-demo
   ```

3. Install ONLYOFFICE Docs React component from **npm** and save it to the *package.json* file with *--save*:

   ```
   npm install --save @onlyoffice/document-editor-react
   ```

   You can also use the following **yarn** command:

   ```
   yarn add @onlyoffice/document-editor-react
   ```

4. Open the *./src/App.js* file in the *onlyoffice-react-demo* project and replace its contents with the following code:

   ```
   import React, { useRef } from 'react';
   import { DocumentEditor } from "@onlyoffice/document-editor-react";

   var onDocumentReady = function (event) {
       console.log("Document is loaded");
   };

   var onLoadComponentError = function (errorCode, errorDescription) {
       switch(errorCode) {
           case -1: // Unknown error loading component
               console.log(errorDescription);
               break;

           case -2: // Error load DocsAPI from http://documentserver/
               console.log(errorDescription);
               break;

           case -3: // DocsAPI is not defined
               console.log(errorDescription);
               break;
       }
   };

   export default function App() {
       return (
           <>
               <DocumentEditor
                   id="docxEditor"
                   documentServerUrl="http://documentserver/"
                   config={{
                       "document": {
                           "fileType": "docx",
                           "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
                           "title": "Example Document Title.docx",
                           "url": "https://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"
                       },
                       "documentType": "word",
                       "editorConfig": {
                           "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/url-to-callback.ashx"
                       }
                   }}
                   events_onDocumentReady={onDocumentReady}
                   onLoadComponentError={onLoadComponentError}
               />
           </>
       );
   }
   ```

   Replace the following lines with your own data:

   * **"http\://documentserver/"** - replace with the URL of your server;
   * **"https\://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"** - replace with the URL to your file;
   * **"https\://example.com/url-to-callback.ashx"** - replace with your callback URL (this is required for the saving functionality to work).

   This JavaScript file will create the *App* component containing the ONLYOFFICE Docs editor configured with basic features.

5. Test the application using the Node.js development server:

   * To start the development server, navigate to the *onlyoffice-react-demo* directory and run:

     ```
     npm run start
     ```

   * To stop the development server, select on the command line or command prompt and press *Ctrl+C*.

## Deploying the demo React application

The easiest way to deploy the application to a production environment is to install [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) and create a static server:

1. Install the *serve* package globally:

   ```
   npm install -g serve
   ```

2. Serve your static site on the 3000 port:

   ```
   serve -s build
   ```

   Another port can be adjusted using the *-l* or *--listen* flags:

   ```
   serve -s build -l 4000
   ```

3. To serve the project folder, go to it and run the *serve* command:

   ```
   cd onlyoffice-react-demo
   serve
   ```

Now you can deploy the application to the created server:

1. Navigate to the *onlyoffice-react-demo* directory and run:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

   The *build* directory will be created with a production build of your app.

2. Copy the contents of the *onlyoffice-react-demo/build* directory to the root directory of the web server (to the *onlyoffice-react-demo* folder).

The application will be deployed on the web server (*http\://localhost:3000* by default).
