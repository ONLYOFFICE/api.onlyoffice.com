## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

Before you proceed to the plugin installation, make sure you have an instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server) that is resolvable and connectable both from Redmine and any end clients. Additionally, ensure that ONLYOFFICE Docs can directly POST to Redmine.

We recommend using [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) to install ONLYOFFICE Docs. Alternatively, you can follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/linux/document/linux-installation.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.

## Installing Redmine ONLYOFFICE integration plugin

To install the plugin, you will need Redmine version 4.2 or higher, or version 5.0 or higher. It is also important to note that the plugin is compatible with Ruby version 2.7.2 or higher, or 3.0.0 or higher. We recommend using Redmine 5 along with Ruby 3.

1. If you are new to Redmine, install it by following [these instructions](https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineInstall).

2. Download the [plugin](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice-redmine/releases):

   ```
   curl --location https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice-redmine/releases/latest/download/onlyoffice_redmine.tar.zst --output onlyoffice_redmine.tar.zst
   ```

3. Unzip it into the plugins directory:

   ```
   tar --extract --file onlyoffice_redmine.tar.zst --directory plugins
   ```

4. Install the dependencies of the plugin if Redmine did not do it automatically:

   ```
   bundle install
   ```

5. Perform the migration:

   ```
   RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=onlyoffice_redmine
   ```

6. Restart Redmine.

Read more about the plugin installation on the Redmine [Wiki page](https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins#Installing-a-plugin).
