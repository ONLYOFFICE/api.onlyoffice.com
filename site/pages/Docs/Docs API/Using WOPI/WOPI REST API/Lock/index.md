**POST /wopi/files/*(file\_id)***

Locks file editing by an online office that requested the lock.

This operation works as follows:

1. The WOPI host checks if a file is currently locked or not.
2. If the file is **unlocked**, the host should lock the file and return **200 OK**.
3. If the file is already **locked** and the **X-WOPI-Lock** value matches the lock currently on the file, the host should refresh the lock timer and return **200 OK**.
4. In all other cases, the host must return **409 Conflict** (*"lock mismatch"*) and include the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header containing the value of the current lock on the file.
5. In the case where the file is locked by a third-party client, hosts should still always include the current lock ID in the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header.
