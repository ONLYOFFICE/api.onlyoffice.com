**POST /wopi/files/*(file\_id)***

Allows for file editing.

This operation works as follows:

1. The WOPI host checks if a file is currently locked or not.
2. If the file is **unlocked**, or if the file is currently **locked** and the **X-WOPI-Lock** value does not match the lock currently on the file, the host must return **409 Conflict** (*"lock mismatch"*) and include the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header containing the value of the current lock on the file. In the case where the file is unlocked, the host must set **X-WOPI-Lock** to the empty string.
3. In the case where the file is locked by a third-party client, hosts should still always include the current lock ID in the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header.
