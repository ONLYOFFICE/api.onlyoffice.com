* How to check DMS portal availability?

  To check the portal availability, you need to send the GET request. If the portal is available, then the *HTTP\_STATUS\_CODE = 200* response is expected.

  * *check.url* - the URL used in the request,
  * *check.headers* - the headers added to the *ajax* request.

  ```
  {
      "name" : "Nextcloud",
      "check": {
          "url": "status.php",
          "headers": 
              "OCS-APIREQUEST": true
          }
  }
  ```
