If you need to compare two documents, you can use **Document Builder**. The steps below will show you how to do it:

1. Create the *compare.docbuilder* script file with the following code:

   ```
   builder.OpenFile("https://example.com/file1.docx");
   var file = builderJS.OpenTmpFile("https://example.com/file2.docx");
   AscCommonWord.CompareDocuments(Api, file, null);
   file.Close();
   builder.SaveFile("docx", "Result.docx");
   builder.CloseFile();
   ```

   where

   *https\://example.com/file1.docx* - the path to the first file for comparing,

   *https\://example.com/file2.docx* - the path to the second file for comparing.

2. Send the [POST request](/editors/documentbuilderapi) to **https\://documentserver/docbuilder** with the following body in the JSON format:

   ```
   {
       "async": false,
       "url": "https://example.com/compare.docbuilder"
   }
   ```

   where

   *https\://example.com/compare.docbuilder* - the path to the *.docbuilder* script.

3. Once the document generation is ready, the response with the absolute URL to the output file of document comparing will be returned:

   ```
   {
      "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
       "urls": {
           "Result.docx": "https://documentserver/Result.docx"
       },
       "end": true
   }
   ```

4. Download the document from the received link. Now you can check all the document differences and accept or reject them using the corresponding buttons on the top toolbar.
