#### void CloseFile();

Closes the file to stop working with it. You can use a single **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** instance to work with all your files, but you need to close the previous file before you can start working with the next one in this case.

## Example

#### C++

```
std::wstring sWorkDirectory = NSUtils::GetBuilderDirectory();
CDocBuilder::Initialize(sWorkDirectory.c_str());
CDocBuilder oBuilder;
oBuilder.CloseFile();
CDocBuilder::Dispose();
```

#### .docbuilder

```
builder.CloseFile();
```
