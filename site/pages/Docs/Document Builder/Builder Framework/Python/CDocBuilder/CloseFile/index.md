#### def CloseFile(self);

Closes the file to stop working with it. You can use a single **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** instance to work with all your files, but you need to close the previous file before you can start working with the next one in this case.

## Example

#### Python

``` python
builder = docbuilder.CDocBuilder()
builder.CloseFile()
```

#### .docbuilder

``` js
builder.CloseFile();
```
