* What is the date/time format used in the response to the requests?

  The response to the requests uses the **Roundtrip** format: 2008-04-10T06:30:00.0000000-07:00\
  where *-07:00* is UTC offset which is set on the portal.

  In case the portal uses UTC time without any offset, the date/time format in the response will be the following: 2008-04-10T06:30:00.0000000Z.

  As for the request, only date can be send in it: 2008-04-10.

  **If you use the date/time in URL request, colons must be avoided and replaced by hyphens: 2008-04-10T06-30-00.000Z.**

  Please note that the UTC date and time without the offset are used in this case.

- Is the response data pagination supported?

  Yes. More information you can find in the [Request filtering](/docspace/apisystem/filters) section.
