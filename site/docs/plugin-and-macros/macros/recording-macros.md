# Reording macros

ONLYOFFICE Editors allow you to record macros. Recording a macro captures your actions, clicks, and movements in the editor and saves them as a macro to automate the process.

## Steps to record a macro

To record a macro:

1. Navigate to the **View** tab.

2. In the **Macros** section, click on **Record Macro** to start recording. If you want to pause the recording, you can click on **Pause Recording** and resume it by clicking on **Resume Recording** when ready.

3. Once you record all the neccesary steps, click on **Stop Recording** to stop recording and save the macro. The generated macro code will be saved in the **Macros** window.

    > While recording a macro can generate a complete and working macro, it might not be accurate. Make sure to review the output carefully and test it thoroughly, especially for complex macros.
