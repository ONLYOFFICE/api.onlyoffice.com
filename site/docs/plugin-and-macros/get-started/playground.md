# Playground

The Playground serves as an interactive platform for users to explore and test the capabilities of the ONLYOFFICE Docs APIs without registration and installing anything. It provides users with various API functionalities, allowing them to experiment with different document types seamlessly.

### Features

- **Script testing**. Write and run JavaScript code using one of the provided ONLYOFFICE APIs ([Office JavaScript API](../../office-api/get-started/overview.md), [Automation API](../../docs-api/usage-api/automation-api.md), or [Plugins API](../../plugin-and-macros/get-started/overview.md)).
- **Live preview**. See the result of your script instantly in the embedded document editor.
- **Multi-platform**. Test for desktop, mobile, or embedded platforms.
- **Customization**. Switch themes and interface languages for convenience.

```mdx-code-block
import {PlaygroundCardsRow} from '@site/src/components/Playground';

<PlaygroundCardsRow searchParams={[{testType: "plugin"}]}/>
```
