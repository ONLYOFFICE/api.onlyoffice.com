## What editors can do

ONLYOFFICE Docs provides the following features:

- creating, editing and viewing text documents, spreadsheets, presentations and fillable forms;
- collaborating on files with other teammates in real time.

ONLYOFFICE Docs API is used to let the developers integrate the ONLYOFFICE Document/Spreadsheet/Presentation/Pdf Editors into their own web sites and setup and manage the editors. ONLYOFFICE Docs can be customized to look and feel like part of your application or webpage by [customizing the user interface](../usage-api/config/editor/customization/customization%20-%20Standard%20branding.md).
