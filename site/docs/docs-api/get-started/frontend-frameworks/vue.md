The ONLYOFFICE Docs Vue.js [component](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-editor-vue) integrates ONLYOFFICE Docs into [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) projects.

## Prerequisites

This procedure requires [Node.js (and npm)](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Creating the demo Vue.js application with ONLYOFFICE Docs editor

This procedure creates a [basic Vue.js application](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create) and installs an ONLYOFFICE Docs editor in it.

1. Open a command line or command prompt and create a Vue.js 3.x project named *onlyoffice-vue-demo* using the [Create Vue Tool](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue):

   ``` sh
   npm create vue@3
   ```

2. Go to the newly created directory:

   ``` sh
   cd onlyoffice-vue-demo
   ```

3. Install ONLYOFFICE Docs Vue.js component from **npm** and save it to the *package.json* file with *--save*:

   ``` sh
   npm install --save @onlyoffice/document-editor-vue
   ```

4. Open the *./src/App.vue* file in the *onlyoffice-vue-demo* project and replace its contents with the following code:

   ``` vue
   <template>
       <DocumentEditor 
           id="docEditor" 
           documentServerUrl="http://documentserver/"
           :config="config"
           :events_onDocumentReady="onDocumentReady"
           :onLoadComponentError="onLoadComponentError"
       /> 
   </template>

   <script lang="ts">
   import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
   import { DocumentEditor } from "@onlyoffice/document-editor-vue";

   export default defineComponent({
       name: 'ExampleComponent',
       components: {
           DocumentEditor
       },
       data() {
           return {
               config: {
                   document: {
                       fileType: "docx",
                       key: "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
                       title: "Example Document Title.docx",
                       url: "https://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"
                   },
                   documentType: "word",
                   editorConfig: {
                       callbackUrl: "https://example.com/url-to-callback.ashx"
                   }
               }
           }
       },
       methods: {
           onDocumentReady() {
               console.log("Document is loaded");
           },
           onLoadComponentError (errorCode, errorDescription) {
               switch(errorCode) {
                   case -1: // Unknown error loading component
                       console.log(errorDescription);
                       break;

                   case -2: // Error load DocsAPI from http://documentserver/
                       console.log(errorDescription);
                       break;

                   case -3: // DocsAPI is not defined
                       console.log(errorDescription);
                       break;
               }
           }
       },
   });
   </script>
   ```

   Replace the following lines with your own data:

   - `http://documentserver/` - replace with the URL of your server;
   - `https://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx` - replace with the URL to your file;
   - `https://example.com/url-to-callback.ashx` - replace with your callback URL (this is required for the saving functionality to work).

5. Test the application using the Vue development server:

   - To start the development server, navigate to the *onlyoffice-vue-demo* directory and run:

     ``` sh
     npm run dev
     ```

   - To stop the development server, select on the command line or command prompt and press *Ctrl+C*.

## Calling editor methods in the Vue.js application

1. Add the `DocEditor.instances` parameter to the `window` object and get the editor object from it by the editor ID:

   ```vue
   const documentEditor = window.DocEditor.instances["docEditor"]
   ```

2. Call any editor [method](../../usage-api/methods.md) from this object:

   ```vue
   documentEditor.showMessage("Welcome to ONLYOFFICE Editor!")
   ```

Example:

```vue
onDocumentReady() {
  const documentEditor = window.DocEditor.instances["docEditor"]

  documentEditor.showMessage("Welcome to ONLYOFFICE Editor!")
}
```

## Deploying the demo Vue.js application

The easiest way to deploy the application to a production environment is to install [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) and create a static server:

1. Install the *serve* package globally:

   ``` sh
   npm install -g serve
   ```

2. Serve your static site on the 3000 port:

   ``` sh
   serve -s build
   ```

   Another port can be adjusted using the *-l* or *--listen* flags:

   ``` sh
   serve -s build -l 4000
   ```

3. To serve the project folder, go to it and run the *serve* command:

   ``` sh
   cd onlyoffice-vue-demo
   serve
   ```

Now you can deploy the application to the created server:

1. Navigate to the *onlyoffice-vue-demo* directory and run:

   ``` sh
   npm run build
   ```

   The *dist* directory will be created with a production build of your app.

2. Copy the contents of the *onlyoffice-vue-demo/dist* directory to the root directory of the web server (to the *onlyoffice-vue-demo* folder).

The application will be deployed on the web server (`http://localhost:3000` by default).
