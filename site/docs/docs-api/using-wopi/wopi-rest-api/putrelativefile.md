# PutRelativeFile

`POST /wopi/files/(file_id)`

Creates a new file on the host based on the current file.

This operation works as follows:

1. The WOPI host checks if a file is currently locked or not.

2. If the file is currently **locked** and the **X-WOPI-Lock** value does not match the lock currently on the file, the host must return **409 Conflict** (*"lock mismatch"*) and include the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header containing the value of the current lock on the file. In the case where the file is unlocked, the host must set **X-WOPI-Lock** to the empty string.

3. If the file is **unlocked**, the host takes the file name from the **X-WOPI-SuggestedTarget** header and modifies it in order to make the request succeed:

   - If the header contains only a file extension (starts with a period), then the resulting file name will consist of this extension and the initial file name without extension.
   - If the header contains a full file name, then it will be a name for the resulting file.

4. Finally, the host creates a new file that has a legal name and does not overwrite any existing files, while preserving the file extension.

## Save Copy As

Starting from version 8.1, the *Save Copy As* functionality is added to the WOPI protocol through the *PutRelativeFile* operation. In the ONLYOFFICE Docs API, this action is implemented as the [onRequestSaveAs](../../usage-api/config/events.md#onrequestsaveas) event.

When the *PutRelativeFile* operation is executed to save a copy of the current file, the *X-WOPI-FileConversion* header is not sent in the request.

To restrict the *Save Copy As* functionality, set the [UserCanNotWriteRelative](./checkfileinfo.md#user-permissions-properties) property in *CheckFileInfo* to *true*.
