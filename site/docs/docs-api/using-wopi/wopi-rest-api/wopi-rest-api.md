[WOPI REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/cloud-storage-partner-program/rest/) specifies a set of operations that enables a client to access and change files stored on a server.

ONLYOFFICE Docs uses the following WOPI operations:

- [CheckFileInfo](CheckFileInfo.md) - returns information about the file properties, access rights and editor settings.
- [GetFile](GetFile.md) - requests a message to retrieve a file for the `HTTP://server/<...>/wopi*/files/<id>/contents` operation.
- [Lock](Lock.md) - locks file editing by an online office that requested the lock.
- [RefreshLock](RefreshLock.md) - refreshes the lock on a file by resetting its automatic expiration timer to 30 minutes.
- [Unlock](Unlock.md) - allows for file editing.
- [PutFile](PutFile.md) - requests a message to update a file for the `HTTP://server/<...>/wopi*/files/<id>/contents` operation.
- [PutRelativeFile](PutRelativeFile.md) - creates a new file on the host based on the current file.
- [RenameFile](RenameFile.md) - renames a file.
