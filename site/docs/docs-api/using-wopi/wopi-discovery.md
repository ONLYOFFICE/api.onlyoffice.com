# WOPI discovery

[WOPI discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/cloud-storage-partner-program/online/discovery) is a process which helps the WOPI server discover a WOPI client by requesting the discovery XML from an online office. WOPI hosts use the discovery XML to specify how to interact with the online office. The requests are sent to the `https://documentserver/hosting/discovery` address where the **documentserver** is the name of the server with the ONLYOFFICE Docs installed.

## WOPI discovery actions

The **action** element of the discovery XML provides the important characteristics of the online office. This element represents:

- available document operations in the online office,
- supported file formats (extensions).

| lang | en-us   | Indicates that the Nextcloud WOPI server includes the document language in the format described in [\[RFC1766\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1766.html). This language is used when creating a new document with the **editnew** action. |

## Collabora specific

Please pay attention to the *discovery.xml* structure of the Collabora connectors. They open the editor via the MIME-type which is included in the *app* element of the following structure:

``` xml
<app name="application/msword">
    <action default="true" ext="" name="edit" urlsrc="http://159.89.20.129:9980/loleaflet/ba528af/loleaflet.html?"/>
</app>
```

The *app* element like this:

``` xml
<app name="Word" favIconUrl="http://localhost:8000/web-apps/apps/documenteditor/main/resources/img/favicon.ico">
```

is ignored by the Collabora connectors.
