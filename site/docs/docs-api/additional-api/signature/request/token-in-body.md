# Token in body

Starting from version 5.2, it is possible to use the token in body parameters with ONLYOFFICE Docs. To enable it, set the [services.CoAuthoring.token.inbox.inBody](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-configuring.aspx#services-CoAuthoring-token-inbox-inBody) and [services.CoAuthoring.token.outbox.inBody](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-configuring.aspx#services-CoAuthoring-token-outbox-inBody) in configuration file to `true`.

## Parameters

| Parameter                                | Type    | Example | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| services.CoAuthoring.token.inbox.inBody  | boolean | false   | Defines if a token is enabled in the incoming request body or not. |
| services.CoAuthoring.token.outbox.inBody | boolean | false   | Defines if a token is enabled in the outgoing request body or not. |

The `payload` for the JSON Web Token contains the request body parameters.

## Incoming request

### Request to receive the status of the edited document

Validation is performed for incoming requests with the commands from the **document storage service** to the [document command service](../../command-service/command-service.md).

Sample parameters of request to receive the status of the edited document:

  ``` json
  {
    "c": "info",
    "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7"
  }
  ```

These parameters must be encoded into the token so that the request looked like this:

Sample of request to receive the status of the edited document:

``` http
POST /command HTTP/1.1
Host: documentserver
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJjIjoiaW5mbyIsImtleSI6IktoaXJ6NnpUUGRmZDcifQ.r_6sThjFABsHMNHhkVdHDSz4jwkbXRQNYdvawkBGJgg"
}
```

As you can see there is no need to include the above parameters into the request body, as all of them are already encoded into the token and sent within it.

### Request to convert the document

Validation is performed for incoming requests with the commands from the **document storage service** to the [document conversion service](../../conversion-api/request.md).
