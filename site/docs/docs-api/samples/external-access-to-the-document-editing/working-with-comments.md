# Working with comments

Collects all the comments from the document and displays them in the custom interface.

<CommentsExternalToolbar/>

## How it works

1. When the user opens a document, the [GetAllComments](/site/docs/plugin-and-macros/interacting-with-editors/text-document-api/Methods/GetAllComments.md) method is executed to collect all the comments from the document and display them in the custom interface. The following comment data is displayed: the comment author, the time when the comment was posted, the comment text, and the comment replies:

    ``` ts
    let comments = [];
    function onDocumentReady() {
      window.connector = docEditor.createConnector();
    
      connector.executeMethod("GetAllComments", null, (data) => {
        comments = data;
      });
    }
    ```

2. When the user clicks the **Add comment** button in the custom interface, the [AddComment](/site/docs/plugin-and-macros/interacting-with-editors/text-document-api/Methods/AddComment.md) method is executed to add a new comment to the document. After this method is called, the [onAddComment](/site/docs/plugin-and-macros/interacting-with-editors/text-document-api/Events/onAddComment.md) event is fired to add a new comment to an array with all the document comments:

    ``` ts
    function onDocumentReady() {
      connector.attachEvent("onAddComment", (val) => {
        const index = comments.findIndex((comment) => {
          return comment["Id"] === val["Id"];
        });
        if (index === -1) {
          comments = [val, ...comments];
        }
      });
    }

    $("#addComment").on("click", () => {
      const comment = $("#addCommentArea").val();
      if (comment) {
        const currentdate = Date.now();
        const datetime = `${currentdate}`;
        connector.executeMethod("AddComment", [{
          Text: comment,
          UserName: "John Smith",
          Time: datetime,
        }]);
      }
    });
    ```

3. When the user clicks the **Remove comment** button in the custom interface, the [RemoveComments](/site/docs/plugin-and-macros/interacting-with-editors/text-document-api/Methods/RemoveComments.md) method is executed to remove a comment from the document. After this method is called, the [onRemoveComment](/site/docs/plugin-and-macros/interacting-with-editors/text-document-api/Events/onRemoveComment.md) event is fired to remove a comment from an array with all the document comments:

    ``` ts
    function onDocumentReady() {
      connector.attachEvent("onRemoveComment", (val) => {
        const index = comments.findIndex((comment) => {
          return comment["Id"] === val["Id"];
        });
        if (index !== -1) {
          comments.splice(index, 1);
        }
      });
    }
    $("#deleteComment").on("click", () => {
      connector.executeMethod("RemoveComments", [[comments[indexComment]["Id"]]]);
    });
    ```

4. When the user clicks the arrow buttons in the custom interface, the [MoveToComment](/site/docs/plugin-and-macros/interacting-with-editors/text-document-api/Methods/MoveToComment.md) method is executed to move between the comments in the document:

    ``` ts
    connector.executeMethod("MoveToComment", [comments[indexComment]["Id"]]);
    ```

5. When the user clicks the **Add reply** button in the custom interface, the [ChangeComment](/site/docs/plugin-and-macros/interacting-with-editors/text-document-api/Methods/ChangeComment.md) method is executed to add a reply to the existing comment by changing the *CommentData* object. After this method is called, the [onChangeCommentData](/site/docs/plugin-and-macros/interacting-with-editors/text-document-api/Events/onChangeCommentData.md) event is fired to add a new comment reply to an array with all the document comments:

    ``` ts
    function onDocumentReady() {
      connector.attachEvent("onChangeCommentData", (val) => {
        const index = comments.findIndex((comment) => {
          return comment["Id"] === val["Id"];
        });
        if (index !== -1) {
          comments[index]["Data"] = val["Data"];
        }
      });
    }
    $("#addReply").on("click", () => {
      const reply = $("#addReplyArea").val();
      if (reply) {
        const datetime = `${Date.now()}`;
        comments[indexComment]["Data"]["Replies"].push({
          Text: reply,
          Time: datetime,
          UserName: "John Smith",
        });

        connector.executeMethod(
          "ChangeComment",
          [comments[indexComment]["Id"],
            comments[indexComment]["Data"]],
        );
      }
    });
    ```
