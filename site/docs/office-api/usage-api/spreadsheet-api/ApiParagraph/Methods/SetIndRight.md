Inherited from [ApiParaPr.SetIndRight](../../ApiParaPr/Methods/SetIndRight.md).

## Example

Push a paragraph away from the right edge inside a shape in a spreadsheet.

```javascript editor-xlsx
// How do I add a right margin to a paragraph in a spreadsheet?

// Shrink the paragraph's line width by pulling its right boundary inward in a spreadsheet.

let worksheet = Api.GetActiveSheet();
let fill = Api.CreateSolidFill(Api.RGB(255, 111, 61));
let stroke = Api.CreateStroke(0, Api.CreateNoFill());
let shape = worksheet.AddShape("flowChartOnlineStorage", 120 * 36000, 70 * 36000, fill, stroke, 0, 2 * 36000, 0, 3 * 36000);
let content = shape.GetContent();
let paragraph = content.GetElement(0);
let paraPr = paragraph.GetParaPr();
paraPr.SetIndRight(2880);
paragraph.AddText("This is the first paragraph with the right offset of 2 inches set to it. ");
paragraph.AddText("This offset is set by the paragraph style. No paragraph inline style is applied. ");
paragraph.AddText("These sentences are used to add lines for demonstrative purposes. ");
```
