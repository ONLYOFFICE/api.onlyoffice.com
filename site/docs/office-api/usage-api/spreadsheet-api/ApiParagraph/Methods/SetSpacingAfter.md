# SetSpacingAfter

Sets the spacing after the current paragraph. If the value of the isAfterAuto parameter is true, then 
any value of the nAfter is ignored. If isAfterAuto parameter is not specified, then it 
will be interpreted as false.

Inherited from [ApiParaPr.SetSpacingAfter](../../ApiParaPr/Methods/SetSpacingAfter.md).

## Example

Add extra space below a paragraph inside a shape in a spreadsheet.

```javascript editor-xlsx
// How do I increase the gap between one paragraph and the next in a spreadsheet?

// Push the following paragraph down by setting a bottom spacing value on the preceding one in a spreadsheet.

let worksheet = Api.GetActiveSheet();
let fill = Api.CreateSolidFill(Api.RGB(255, 111, 61));
let stroke = Api.CreateStroke(0, Api.CreateNoFill());
let shape = worksheet.AddShape("flowChartOnlineStorage", 120 * 36000, 70 * 36000, fill, stroke, 0, 2 * 36000, 0, 3 * 36000);
let content = shape.GetContent();
let paragraph = content.GetElement(0);
let paraPr = paragraph.GetParaPr();
paraPr.SetSpacingAfter(1440);
paragraph.AddText("This is an example of setting a space after a paragraph. ");
paragraph.AddText("The second paragraph will have an offset of one inch from the top. ");
paragraph.AddText("This is due to the fact that the first paragraph has this offset enabled.");
paragraph = Api.CreateParagraph();
paragraph.AddText("This is the second paragraph and it is one inch away from the first paragraph.");
content.Push(paragraph);
```
