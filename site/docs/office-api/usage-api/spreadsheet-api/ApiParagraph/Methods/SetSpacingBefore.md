# SetSpacingBefore

Sets the spacing before the current paragraph. If the value of the isBeforeAuto parameter is true, then 
any value of the nBefore is ignored. If isBeforeAuto parameter is not specified, then 
it will be interpreted as false.

Inherited from [ApiParaPr.SetSpacingBefore](../../ApiParaPr/Methods/SetSpacingBefore.md).

## Example

Add extra space above a paragraph inside a shape in a spreadsheet.

```javascript editor-xlsx
// How do I increase the gap between one paragraph and the one before it in a spreadsheet?

// Separate two paragraphs visually by applying a top spacing value to the second one in a spreadsheet.

let worksheet = Api.GetActiveSheet();
let fill = Api.CreateSolidFill(Api.RGB(255, 111, 61));
let stroke = Api.CreateStroke(0, Api.CreateNoFill());
let shape = worksheet.AddShape("flowChartOnlineStorage", 120 * 36000, 70 * 36000, fill, stroke, 0, 2 * 36000, 0, 3 * 36000);
let content = shape.GetContent();
let paragraph = content.GetElement(0);
paragraph.AddText("This is an example of setting a space before a paragraph. ");
paragraph.AddText("The second paragraph will have an offset of one inch from the top. ");
paragraph.AddText("This is due to the fact that the second paragraph has this offset enabled.");
paragraph = Api.CreateParagraph();
let paraPr = paragraph.GetParaPr();
paraPr.SetSpacingBefore(1440);
paragraph.AddText("This is the second paragraph and it is one inch away from the first paragraph.");
content.Push(paragraph);
```
