Sets the spacing before the current paragraph. If the value of the isBeforeAuto parameter is true, then 
any value of the nBefore is ignored. If isBeforeAuto parameter is not specified, then 
it will be interpreted as false.

paragraph.AddText("The second paragraph will have an offset of one inch from the top. ");
paragraph.AddText("This is due to the fact that the second paragraph has this offset enabled.");
