# GetKeepNext

Returns the keep next value of the current paragraph.

Inherited from [ApiParaPr.GetKeepNext](../../ApiParaPr/Methods/GetKeepNext.md).

## Example

Read whether a paragraph is set to stay on the same page as the following paragraph in a document.

```javascript editor-docx
// How do I check if a paragraph is configured to stay with the next paragraph in a document?

// Verify the keep-with-next setting before adjusting page break behavior around headings or captions.

let doc = Api.GetDocument();
let paragraph = doc.GetElement(0);
let paraPr = paragraph.GetParaPr();
paraPr.SetKeepNext(true);
paragraph.AddText("This is a paragraph kept on the same page as the following paragraph.");
let keepNext = paraPr.GetKeepNext();
let paragraph2 = Api.CreateParagraph();
paragraph2.AddText("Keep next: " + keepNext);
doc.Push(paragraph2);
```
