```javascript editor-docx
// How do I adjust the vertical distance between lines of text in a paragraph in a document?

let doc = Api.GetDocument();
let paragraph = doc.GetElement(0);
paragraph.SetSpacingLine(3 * 240, "auto");
paragraph.AddText("Paragraph 1. Spacing: 3 times of a common paragraph line spacing.");
paragraph.AddLineBreak();
paragraph.AddText("These sentences are used to add lines for demonstrative purposes. ");
paragraph.AddText("These sentences are used to add lines for demonstrative purposes. ");
paragraph.AddText("These sentences are used to add lines for demonstrative purposes. ");
paragraph.AddText("These sentences are used to add lines for demonstrative purposes.");

doc.Push(paragraph);
paragraph = Api.CreateParagraph();
paragraph.SetSpacingLine(400, "atLeast");
