# SetDistances

Specifies the minimum distance which will be maintained between the edges of the current drawing object and any
subsequent text.

Inherited from [ApiDrawing.SetDistances](../../ApiDrawing/Methods/SetDistances.md).

## Example

Set the spacing between a drawing and the surrounding text in a document.

```javascript editor-docx
// How do I control the gap between a shape and nearby text in a document?

// Keep text away from a floating shape by defining margins on each side of the drawing in a document.

let doc = Api.GetDocument();
let paragraph = doc.GetElement(0);
paragraph.AddText("This is a paragraph with a shape. ");
paragraph.AddText("The text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the object. ");
paragraph.AddText("The distance between the shape and the text is 1 inch (914400 English measure units).");
let gs1 = Api.CreateGradientStop(Api.RGB(255, 213, 191), 0);
let gs2 = Api.CreateGradientStop(Api.RGB(255, 111, 61), 100000);
let fill = Api.CreateRadialGradientFill([gs1, gs2]);
let stroke = Api.CreateStroke(0, Api.CreateNoFill());
let drawing = Api.CreateShape("rect", 1908000, 1404000, fill, stroke);
drawing.SetDistances(914400, 0, 914400, 0);
drawing.SetWrappingStyle("square");
paragraph.AddDrawing(drawing);
paragraph = Api.CreateParagraph();
paragraph.AddText("This is another paragraph.");
doc.Push(paragraph);
```
