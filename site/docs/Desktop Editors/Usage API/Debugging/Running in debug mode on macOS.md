## Running the application

Starting from version 7.1, you can run ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors with the `--ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep` flag. It can be used with the following values:

### Parameters

| Value   | Usage                                        | Description                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | --ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep=1       | Runs the application.                                      |
| 0       | --ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep=0       | Stops the application.                                     |
| default | --ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep=default | The default application condition - the app is turned off. |

To launch ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors with this flag, use the same instructions as for the `--ascdesktop-support-debug-info` flag above. The only difference is that the `--ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep` flag stores the value passed to it. You will not need to specify it every time you run the application.
