To access the editor features in your mobile application, integrate it with ONLYOFFICE editors via the WebView component - a system component that is responsible for opening web pages within applications. After that, users will be able to view, create and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, fill out and read PDFs directly on their iOS or Android devices.

> Please note that ONLYOFFICE mobile web editors are available only for commercial builds of [Enterprise](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docs-enterprise.aspx) and [Developer](https://www.onlyoffice.com/developer-edition.aspx) editions.
