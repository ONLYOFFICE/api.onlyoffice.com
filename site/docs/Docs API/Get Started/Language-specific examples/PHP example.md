## Overview

This example will help you integrate ONLYOFFICE Docs into your web application written on PHP.

> It is intended for testing purposes and demonstrating functionality of the editors. **DO NOT** use this integration example on your own server without proper code modifications. In case you enabled the test example, disable it before going for production.

## Important security info

Please keep in mind the following security aspects when you are using test examples:

- There is no protection of the storage from unauthorized access since there is no need for authorization.
- There are no checks against parameter substitution in links, since the parameters are generated by the code according to the pre-arranged scripts.
- There are no data checks in requests of saving the file after editing, since each test example is intended for requests only from ONLYOFFICE Docs.
- There are no prohibitions on using test examples from other sites, since they are intended to interact with ONLYOFFICE Docs from another domain.

## Step 1. Install the prerequisites and run the website with the editors

The PHP example offers various installation options, but we highly recommend using Docker for this purpose.

### Option 1. Using Docker

To run the example using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), you will need [Docker Desktop 4.17.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) or [Docker Engine 20.10.23](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) with [Docker Compose 2.15.1](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Additionally, you might want to consider installing [GNU Make 4.4.1](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), although it is optional. These are the minimum versions required for the tools.

Once you have everything installed, download the release archive and unarchive it:

``` sh
curl --output PHP.Example.zip --location https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-server-integration/releases/latest/download/PHP.Example.zip
unzip PHP.Example.zip
```

Then open the example directory and [up containers](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-server-integration/blob/880423545fc0c1f21b004e1c8121a319809f4b72/web/documentserver-example/php/Makefile#L60):

``` sh
cd "PHP Example"
make compose-prod
```

By default, the server starts at *localhost:80*.

To configure the example, you can edit the environment variables in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-server-integration/blob/880423545fc0c1f21b004e1c8121a319809f4b72/web/documentserver-example/php/docker-compose.yml). See [below](#step-3-configure-the-php-example) for more information about environment variables.

### Option 2. On local machine

Download and install ONLYOFFICE Docs (packaged as Document Server):

[Get ONLYOFFICE Docs](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-docs.aspx?from=api#docs-developer)

Check the detailed guide to learn how to install it on [Windows](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-install-windows.aspx?from=api_php_example), [Linux](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-install-ubuntu.aspx?from=api_php_example), or [Docker](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-install-docker.aspx?from=api_php_example).

To run the example on your local machine, you will need [PHP 8.2.11](https://www.php.net/) with [Composer 2.6.5](https://getcomposer.org/). Additionally, you might want to consider installing [GNU Make 4.4.1](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), although it is optional. These are the minimum versions required for the tools.

Once you have everything installed, download the release archive and unarchive it:

``` sh
curl --output PHP.Example.zip --location https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-server-integration/releases/latest/download/PHP.Example.zip
unzip PHP.Example.zip
```

Then open the example directory, [install dependencies](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-server-integration/blob/880423545fc0c1f21b004e1c8121a319809f4b72/web/documentserver-example/php/Makefile#L16), and [start the server](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/document-server-integration/blob/880423545fc0c1f21b004e1c8121a319809f4b72/web/documentserver-example/php/Makefile#L40):

``` sh
cd "PHP Example"
make prod
make server-prod
```

By default, the server starts at *0.0.0.0:9000*.

To configure the example, you can pass the environment variables before the command that starts the server. See [below](#step-3-configure-the-php-example) for more information about environment variables.

## Step 2. Check accessibility

In case the example and ONLYOFFICE Docs are installed on different computers, make sure that your server with the example installed has access to the ONLYOFFICE Docs with the address which you specify instead of **documentserver** in the configuration files.

Make sure that the ONLYOFFICE Docs in its turn has access to the server with the example installed with the address which you specify instead of **example.com** in the configuration files.

## Step 3. Configure the PHP example

The example is configured by changing environment variables.

| Parameter                      | Example                 | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADDRESS                        | 0.0.0.0                 | The address where the server should be started.                         |
| PORT                           | 80                      | The port on which the server should be running.                         |
| DOCUMENT\_SERVER\_PRIVATE\_URL | `http://proxy:8080`     | The URL through which the server will communicate with ONLYOFFICE Docs. |
| DOCUMENT\_SERVER\_PUBLIC\_URL  | `http://localhost:8080` | The URL through which a user will communicate with ONLYOFFICE Docs.     |
| EXAMPLE\_URL                   | `http://proxy`          | The URL through which ONLYOFFICE Docs will communicate with the server. |
| JWT\_SECRET                    | your-256-bit-secret     | JWT authorization secret. Leave blank to disable authorization.         |

If you integrated the editors successfully the result should look like the [demo preview](./Language-specific%20examples.md#demo-preview) on our site.
