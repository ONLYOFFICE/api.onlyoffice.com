## How to update the name of the document for all collaborative editors?

To do that the [meta](../../Additional%20API/Command%20service/meta.md) option is available. The request must be sent to the [document command service](../../Additional%20API/Command%20service/Command%20service.md), using the *meta* value for the *c* parameter:

  ``` json
  {
    "c": "meta",
    "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
    "meta": {
      "title": "Example Document Title.docx"
    }
  }
  ```
