| type      | string | "text"       | The form type (**text**, **checkBox**, **picture**, **comboBox**, **dropDownList**, **dateTime**, **radio**). |

The object is present when the *status* value is equal to *6* and the *forcesavetype* value is equal to *3*.

Type: object

## history

It contains the object *changes* and *serverVersion*, which must be sent as properties *changes* and *serverVersion* of the object sent as the argument to the [refreshHistory](./Methods.md#refreshhistory) method.

Type: object

## key*

Defines the edited document identifier.

Type: string

## status*

- **1** - document is being edited;
- **2** - document is ready for saving;
- **3** - document saving error has occurred;
- **4** - document is closed with no changes;
- **6** - document is being edited, but the current document state is saved;
- **7** - error has occurred while force saving the document.

Type: integer

## url

Type: string

## userdata

Defines the custom information sent to the command service for the [forcesave](../Additional%20API/Command%20service/forcesave.md) and [info](../Additional%20API/Command%20service/info.md) commands in case it was present in the request.

Type: string

## users

Defines the list of the identifiers of the users who opened the document for editing; when the document has been changed the **users** will return the identifier of the user who was the last to edit the document (for *status* **2** and *status* **6** replies).

Type: array of string

\* *- required parameter*

The server stores all *callbackUrls* and chooses which one to use depending on the user who performed the action.

Since version 5.5, [callbackUrl](./Config/Editor/Editor.md#callbackurl) is selected depending on the *status* of the request. Starting from version 4.4 to version 5.5, *callbackUrl* is used from the last user who joined the co-editing. Prior to version 4.4, when co-editing, *callbackUrl* is used from the user who first opened the file for editing.

Since version 7.0, *callbackUrl* is used from the last tab of the same user. Prior to version 7.0, *callbackUrl* from the first user tab was used.

## Possible document statuses and their description

### Status 1

It is received every user connection to or disconnection from document co-editing. Their *callbackUrl* is used.

Please note that the *status* **1** can be also received when the user is returned to the document with no changes after the Internet problems. This situation can be described as follows:

- When the user opens a document, the *status* **1** is sent.
- If the Internet connection is lost and the user has not made any changes to the document, the *status* **4** is sent. An error is displayed on the screen and the document is opened in the viewer.
- Within 100 seconds, the Internet connection is restored, the user is reconnected to the document and the *status* **1** is sent again.
- Now the user can continue to edit the document. The *status* **2** or **4** will be received depending on whether the user made any changes to the document or not.

### Status 2 (3)

It is received [10 seconds](../Get%20Started/How%20It%20Works/Saving%20file.md#save-delay) after the document is closed for editing with the identifier of the user who was the last to send the changes to the document editing service. The *callbackUrl* from the user who made the last changes to the file is used.

### Status 4

It is received after the document is closed for editing with no changes by the last user. Their *callbackUrl* is used.

### Status 6 (7)

It is received when the force saving request is performed.The *callbackUrl* depends on *forcesavetype* parameter:

- If *forcesavetype* parameter is set to **1**, the *callbackUrl* from the user who clicked the **Save** button is used.
- If *forcesavetype* parameter is set to **0** or **2**, the *callbackUrl* from the user who made the last changes to the file is used.
- If *forcesavetype* parameter is set to **3**, the *callbackUrl* from the user who clicked the **Submit** button is used.Starting from version 5.5 to version 6.1, the *callbackUrl* from the user who made the last changes to the file is always used.

## Examples of requests

  ],
  "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
  "status": 1,
  "users": ["6d5a81d0", "78e1e841"]
}
```

### Sample of JSON object sent to the "callbackUrl" address by document editing service when the user changed the document and closed it for editing

<!-- The 'changes' and 'serverVersion' fields should be left as they are, since the information about the types of these properties is not known. -->

<!-- eslint-skip -->

``` json
{
  "key": "Khirz6zTPdfd7",
  "status": 4
}
```

### Sample of JSON object sent to the "callbackUrl" address by document editing service after the [forcesave](../Additional%20API/Command%20service/forcesave.md) command had been received

<!-- The 'changes' and 'serverVersion' fields should be left as they are, since the information about the types of these properties is not known. -->

<!-- eslint-skip -->

``` json
{
  "changesurl": "https://documentserver/url-to-changes.zip",

  "status": 6,
  "url": "https://documentserver/url-to-edited-document.docx",
  "users": ["6d5a81d0"],
  "userdata": "sample userdata"
}
```

## Response from the document storage service

The **document storage service** must return the following response, otherwise the **document editor** will display an error message:

``` json
{
  "error": 0
}
```

The **document manager** and **document storage service** are either included to ONLYOFFICE Workspace or must be implemented by the software integrators who use ONLYOFFICE Docs on their own server.
