# Encryption

Starting from version 5.6, ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors offers support for Private Rooms, secure workspace where every symbol you type is encrypted end-to-end even if you co-edit documents in real time. Using ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors makes it possible to encrypt and decrypt the data on the client, ensuring endpoint security.

## Processing desktop editors commands

Declare the *cloudCryptoCommand* function to process messages from the desktop app:

``` ts
window.cloudCryptoCommand = function cloudCryptoCommand(type, params, callback) {}
```

### type

- *encryptionKeys* - to save private and public keys to the parameters;

- *relogin* - to re-enter the portal after unsuccessful keys decryption;

  ``` ts
  callback({
    keys: [{
      userId: "78e1e841",
      publicKey: "yyy",
    }],
