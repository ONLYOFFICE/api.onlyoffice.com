# Operations with encrypted files

To perform operations with encrypted files, including file encryption, decryption, creation, editing and sharing, ONLYOFFICE uses the individual credentials of users (RSA key pair) and a document password (document encryption key). The processes of uploading and sharing encrypted files are described here.

## Uploading encrypted documents

To upload encrypted files in the desktop app, replace the standard *input type = file* call with the *cloudCryptoCommand* function with the *upload* type. The *params* object has the following values:

```mdx-code-block
import APITable from '@site/src/components/APITable/APITable';

<APITable>
```

| Name           | Type   | Example                                    | Description                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cryptoEngineId | string | `"{FFF0E1EB-13DB-4678-B67D-FF0A41DBBCEF}"` | Defines the **Encryption** plugin ID.                                                                                                      |
| filter         | string | `"*.docx *.xlsx *.pptx"`                   | Defines the document types that can be encrypted. Currently, it is possible to encrypt only OOXML formats, which are DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX. |

```mdx-code-block
</APITable>
```

### Example

``` ts
window.AscDesktopEditor.cloudCryptoCommand("upload", {
  cryptoEngineId: "{FFF0E1EB-13DB-4678-B67D-FF0A41DBBCEF}",
  filter: "*.docx *.xlsx *.pptx",
}, callback);
```

After the user chooses the files, they will be encrypted in a loop and transferred to *callback*:

``` ts
callback({
  bytes: [],
  name: "Example Document Title.docx",
  isCrypto: true,
})
```

## Sharing encrypted documents

To share the encrypted document, call the *cloudCryptoCommand* function with the *share* type. The *params* object has the following values:

```mdx-code-block
<APITable>
```

| Name           | Type   | Example                                              | Description                                               |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| cryptoEngineId | string | `"{FFF0E1EB-13DB-4678-B67D-FF0A41DBBCEF}"`           | Defines the **Encryption** plugin ID.                     |
| file           | string | `"https://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"` | Defines the absolute url to the document.                 |
| keys           | array  | `[{"userId":"78e1e841","publicKey":"yyy"}, ...]`     | Defines the pairs of user ids and associated public keys. |

```mdx-code-block
</APITable>
```

### Example

``` ts
window.AscDesktopEditor.cloudCryptoCommand("share", {
  cryptoEngineId: "{FFF0E1EB-13DB-4678-B67D-FF0A41DBBCEF}",
  file: ["https://example.com/url-to-example-document.docx"],
  keys: [{
    userId: "78e1e841",
    publicKey: "yyy",
  }],
}, callback);
```

The file is uploaded by the desktop app and encrypted. The access rights to the file are transferred to it with keys. After that, it is transmitted to *callback*:

``` ts
callback({
  bytes: [],
  isCrypto: true,
})
```
