Before you start working on documents stored within your cloud, you need to log in to it.

## Login

Use the [execCommand](./execCommand.md) method to display a cloud in the **Connected clouds** list. When the *portal:login* command is sent, the cloud is registered and listed on the **Connected clouds** page. Call the command on all the pages you can access after logging in to your cloud. Parameters are specified in the format of a string with the serialized *json* as follows:

``` json
{
  "displayName": "user name", 
  "email": "user@email.addr",
  "domain": "domain name",
  "provider": "provider",
  "uiTheme": "theme",
  "userId": "user id"
}
```

### displayName

Defines the user name displayed on the **Connected clouds** page.

> This field is required.

Type: string

Example: "John Smith"

### email

Defines the user email displayed on the **Connected clouds** page.

Type: string

Example: `john@example.com`

### domain

Defines the cloud name and the cloud entry point.

> This field is required.

Type: string

Example: `https://exampledomain.com`

### provider

Defines the provider id used to refer to the desktop app in the JavaScript commands (the same as in the [config](./adding-a-dms-provider.md)).

> This field is required.

Type: string

Example: "onlyoffice"

### uiTheme

Defines the editor theme settings. It can be set in two ways:

- **theme id** - the user sets the theme parameter by its id (**theme-light**, **theme-classic-light**, **theme-dark**, **theme-contrast-dark**);
- **default theme** - the default dark or light theme value will be set (**default-dark**, **default-light**).

The default light theme is **theme-classic-light**.The first option has higher priority.

Apart from the available editor themes, the user can also customize their own [color themes](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-change-theme.aspx) for the application interface.

Type: string

Example: "theme-dark"

### userId

Defines the user id.

> This field is required.

Type: string

Example: "78e1e841"

### Example

``` ts
const params = {
  displayName: "John Smith",
  email: "john@example.com",
  domain: "https://exampledomain.com",
  provider: "onlyoffice",
  uiTheme: "theme-dark",
  userId: "78e1e841",
}
window.AscDesktopEditor.execCommand("portal:login", JSON.stringify(params))
```

## Logout

Use the [execCommand](./execCommand.md) method to remove a cloud from the **Connected clouds** list. When the *portal:logout* command is sent, the cloud will be removed from the list on the **Connected clouds** page. Cookies for this domain will be cleared. Parameters are specified in the format of a string with the serialized *json* as follows:

``` json
{
  "domain": "domain name"
}
```

### domain

Defines the cloud name and the cloud entry point.

Type: string

Example: `https://exampledomain.com`

### Example

``` ts
window.AscDesktopEditor.execCommand("portal:logout", JSON.stringify({
  domain: "https://exampledomain.com",
}))
```
