To integrate **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** into your own application on **.Net (C#) or .Net (C# MVC)** you need to download and install **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** to your computer and use the [.Net (C#) or .Net (C# MVC) example](./Overview.md) for the integration. This guide will show you the sequence of actions to integrate **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** successfully.

## Step 1. Download and install ONLYOFFICE Document Builder

First, download **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** and install it to your computer:

[Get ONLYOFFICE Document Builder](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-builder.aspx?from=api)

## Step 2. Install the prerequisites

To run your website with the **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** successfully, check if your system meets the necessary system requirements. It has got to have the following components installed:

- Microsoft .NET Framework: version 4.0 or later (download it from the [official Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=30653));
- Internet Information Services: version 7 or later;
- Microsoft Visual Studio (download the latest version from the [official Visual Studio website](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs)).

## Step 3. Download the .Net (C#) / .Net (C# MVC) example code and build your application

[Download](./Overview.md) the .Net (C#) or .Net (C# MVC) example from our site and unpack it somewhere to your computer.

Open the **DocumentBuilder.sln** solution file from the unpacked project folder using the **Visual Studio** application. Wait while the project loads.

Once the project is completely loaded, go to the **Visual Studio** top menu and choose **Project** -> **Rebuild Solution**. The project will be rebuilt, after that you can run it in your browser using the green triangle button with the browser name at the top panel.

## Step 4. Running your website with the ONLYOFFICE Document Builder

If you want to run the example application using the Microsoft **IIS** service, you will need to follow the additional steps below.

1. ### Enable ASP.NET 4.6 IIS features

   Go to **Start** -> **Control Panel** -> **Programs and Features** and click the **Turn Windows features on or off** left menu option.

   There select **Internet Information Services** -> **World Wide Web Services** -> **Application Development Features** and enable all the options for **.NET 4.6** (these include **.NET Extensibility 4.6** and **ASP.NET 4.6** options):

   Please make sure that the **.NET Framework 4.6 Advanced Services** -> **ASP.NET 4.6** is also enabled.

2. ### Run the Internet Information Service (IIS) manager

   To do that go to **Start** -> **Control Panel** -> **Administrative Tools** and run the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

3. ### Add your website in the IIS Manager

   On the **Connections** panel right-click the **Sites** node in the tree, then click **Add Website...**:

   ![Add website](/assets/images/docbuilder/csharp/add.png)

4. ### Configure your website

   In the **Add Website** dialog box specify the name of the folder with the .Net (C#) / .Net (C# MVC) project in the **Site name** box.

   Specify the path to the folder with your project in the **Physical path** box.

   Specify the unique value used only for this website in the **Port** box:

   <img alt="Site name" src="/assets/images/docbuilder/csharp/sitename.png" width="416px" />

5. ### Check for the .NET platform version specified in IIS manager for you website

   Choose the **v4.0.** version for **.NET CLR Version** clicking the **Application Pool** then right-clicking the platform name select the **Set application pool defaults** and finally set the necessary **.NET CLR version**:

   <img alt="Platform" src="/assets/images/docbuilder/csharp/platform.png" width="416px" />

6. ### Browse your website with the IIS manager

   Right-click the site, select the **Manage Website** contextual menu option, then use **Browse**:

   ![Browse](/assets/images/docbuilder/csharp/browse.png)

If you want to experiment with the code changes, you can find the main application code in the *\DocumentBuilder\Controllers\\* control. The path to the **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** executable can be changed in the **web.config** file in the following line:

``` xml
<configuration>
    <appSettings>
        <add key="builder-path" value="C:\ONLYOFFICE\DocumentBuilder\docbuilder.exe" />
    </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

Set it to the actual path of the **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** on your computer.
