5. Specify the settings for your application:

## Basic info

### App name

The application name that will be displayed on all consent screens and in the app list.

Presence: required

### Website URL

The URL to the home page of the application website.

Presence: required

### App icon

The application icon that will be displayed on all consent screens and in the app list. Available icon extensions: JPG, PNG, or SVG. The required icon size is 32x32.
Presence: required

### Description

The application brief description.

Presence: optional

### Authentication method

The verification method when receiving a JWT token. To receive the token, you will need to send the SHA key. Check **Allow public client (PKCE)** to use PKCE.

PKCE ([RFC 7636](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636)) is an extension to the [Authorization Code flow](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

PKCE is not a form of client authentication, and PKCE is not a replacement for a client secret or other client authentication. PKCE is recommended even if a client is using a client secret or other form of [client authentication](https://oauth.net/2/client-authentication/) like [private_key_jwt](https://oauth.net/private-key-jwt/).

Because PKCE is not a replacement for client authentication, it does not allow treating a public client as a confidential client.

Presence: optional

### Redirects URLS 

The URLs where the user will be redirected after successfully passing the consent screen. Enter the address and press the **Add** button. You can specify several URLs by clicking ![Plus icon](/assets/images/docspace/plus.png). For example, for test and production versions.

Presence: required

### Allowed origins

The URLs of sources that will be able to make requests to the DocSpace API without CORS blocking. Enter the address and press the **Add** button. You can specify several URLs by clicking ![Plus icon](/assets/images/docspace/plus.png).

Presence: required

## Access scopes

Defines the capabilities of a third-party application in relation to Docspace API. Scopes are used to limit your app's access to all user-related data, and they'll let you specify exactly what kind of access you need. This parameter is required.
