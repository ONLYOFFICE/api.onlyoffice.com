Connect the [ONLYOFFICE Apps MCP server](index.md) to Claude Desktop and start interacting with your ONLYOFFICE Apps through natural language.

## Step 1: Connect to MCP client

[MCP clients](clients.md) like Claude, VS Code, and Devin Desktop act as a bridge to the ONLYOFFICE Apps MCP server, enabling LLMs to access and use the ONLYOFFICE Apps workspace and tools, thus improving the overall capabilities of ONLYOFFICE Apps. This guide uses the Claude Desktop client and connects to a local MCP server. You can also [access via a remote server](installation.md#access-via-the-remote-onlyoffice-apps-mcp-server).

:::note
Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed on your system.
:::

To connect Claude Desktop to your local MCP server:

1. Open Claude Desktop.
2. Navigate to **Settings**.
3. Navigate to **Developer**.
4. Click **Edit config**.
5. Open the configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`) in a text editor.
6. Add the `mcpServers` section from the example below to the top level of the file. If the file already contains other settings, copy the example without its outer braces and separate it from the existing settings with a comma:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "onlyoffice-apps": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--interactive",
           "--rm",
           "--env",
           "DOCSPACE_BASE_URL",
           "--env",
           "DOCSPACE_API_KEY",
           "onlyoffice/docspace-mcp"
         ],
         "env": {
           "DOCSPACE_BASE_URL": "https://your-instance.onlyoffice.com",
           "DOCSPACE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Where:
- `DOCSPACE_BASE_URL` - the URL of your ONLYOFFICE Apps instance (e.g. https://your-instance.onlyoffice.com).
- `DOCSPACE_API_KEY` - your personal API key generated in ONLYOFFICE Apps **Developer Tools** → **API keys** (open **Developer Tools** from the banner at the bottom of the left sidebar).

7. Save the file and quit Claude Desktop.

:::note
It's important to quit and not just close the Claude Desktop window as quitting and restarting the app reloads the `claude_desktop_config.json` configuration with the new `mcpServers` entry. On Windows, right-click the Claude icon in the system tray and select **Exit**.

## Step 2: Confirm the connection

1. Open Claude Desktop.
2. Click **+** > **Connectors** on the chat bar.

   Our newly configured MCP server (**onlyoffice-apps**) is now enabled.

## Step 3: Interact with your ONLYOFFICE Apps using the newly connected client

Now we have our connection, let us interact with ONLYOFFICE Apps via Claude:

1. Let's create a new room. Claude requests permission to create this room.

![This image shows the command to create a room](/img/create-new-room.light.png#gh-light-mode-only)![This image shows the command to create a room](/img/create-new-room.dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

   You can confirm this new room in your ONLYOFFICE Apps account.

2. Now, create a new document in this room.

   Confirm the new document was created.

   You can confirm the existence of this new document in the new room in your ONLYOFFICE Apps.
