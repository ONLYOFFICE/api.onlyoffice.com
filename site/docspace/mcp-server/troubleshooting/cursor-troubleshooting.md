title: Troubleshooting issues with Cursor client

This page explains some errors when connecting the DocSpace MCP server to the Cursor client via the local MCP server. 

## Docker image fails to pull

Ensure Docker is running and you have internet access. Try pulling the image manually to see the full error message:

```bash
docker pull onlyoffice/docspace-mcp
```

If you are behind a corporate proxy, configure Docker to use it: **Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Proxies**.

## MCP server starts but Cursor does not list any tools

Run the container manually to check for startup errors:

```bash
docker run --interactive --rm \
  --env DOCSPACE_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.onlyoffice.com \
  --env DOCSPACE_API_KEY=your-api-key \
  onlyoffice/docspace-mcp
```

Review the output for error messages and fix the reported issue before reconnecting in Cursor.

## Permission denied when running Docker

On Linux, your user account may not be in the `docker` group. Add your user and restart the session:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
