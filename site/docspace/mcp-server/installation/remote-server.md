# Remote Server

This instruction describes how to connect to the DocSpace MCP server running on
a remote machine.

## Public Instance

The public instance is available at https://mcp.onlyoffice.com/mcp for clients
that support modern Streamable HTTP transport and at
https://mcp.onlyoffice.com/sse for clients that support only the legacy SSE
transport. Prefer to use the Streamable HTTP transport whenever possible.

The public instance supports authentication using OAuth, API key, Personal
Access Token (PAT), username/password pair, or raw `Authorization` header.
Prefer to use OAuth authentication whenever possible.

The public instance provides access to all available tools by default. Tool
selection can be customized using query parameters or custom headers. However,
prefer to use the MCP client interface for tool configuration when supported.

connecting to the public instance.

```
