**DocSpace Plugins SDK** allows developers to create their own plugins and add them to the DocSpace portal.

This documentation describes:

- How to [create](../Usage%20SDK/Creating%20Plugin%20Template.md), [code](../Usage%20SDK/Coding%20Plugin/Coding%20Plugin.md), [build](../Usage%20SDK/Building%20Plugin.md), and [upload](../Usage%20SDK/Adding%20Plugin.md) a plugin
- What [plugin types](../Usage%20SDK/Coding%20Plugin/Plugin%20Types/Plugin%20Types.md) and [items](../Usage%20SDK/Coding%20Plugin/Plugin%20Items/Plugin%20Items.md) are available
- What the [plugin structure](../Usage%20SDK/Plugin%20Structure.md) consists of
- How to use plugin variables, methods, [messages](../Usage%20SDK/Coding%20Plugin/Plugin%20Message.md), and [events](../Usage%20SDK/Coding%20Plugin/Events.md)
- What [plugin components](../Usage%20SDK/Coding%20Plugin/Plugin%20Components/Plugin%20Components.md) can be used to build a plugin

## What plugins can do

Here are some examples of what you can do with ONLYOFFICE DocSpace plugins:

- connect third-party services, like [Draw.io](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins/tree/master/draw.io), [Speech to Text Conversion](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins/tree/master/speech-to-text), etc.;
- enhance the existing user experience and the editorsâ€™ functionality: [PDF-converter](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins/tree/master/pdf-converter).

Code samples are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins).

## How to create plugins

To create your own plugin, you need to follow a few steps:

1. Learn the fundamental concepts for building plugins on the [Getting started](./Getting%20Started.md) page and write code that defines the plugin appearance and behavior.
2. After creating the plugin, build it using the instructions [here](../Usage%20SDK/Building%20Plugin.md).
3. Now you can upload the plugin to the DocSpace portal and use it.
