# Adding plugin

You can upload your own plugins to your server. For the DocSpace Saas solution, only system plugins created by our developers are available.

## Enabling system plugins

By default, system plugins are turned off. But you can enable them by following the instructions below:

1. In the lower left corner, click ![More icon](/assets/images/docspace/more-icon.png#gh-light-mode-only)![More icon](/assets/images/docspace/more-icon.dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) and open the **Settings** page.

2. Go to the **Integration** section.

3. Open the **Plugins** tab.

   ![DocSpace plugins](/assets/images/docspace/docspace-plugins.png)

4. Enable a plugin with a switcher.

   <img alt="Plugin switcher" src="/assets/images/docspace/switcher.png" width="400px" />

After that, the plugin will function automatically unless additional settings need to be specified.

A list of the system plugins can be also found in the **Developer Tools** section on the **Plugins SDK** tab. For each plugin there is a link to the plugin repository, where you can find the information about the plugin structure and code.

Now the plugin is available to use.

## Uploading plugins

> You can upload your own plugins only in the DocSpace on-premises solution. In the SaaS solution, this option is unavailable.

1. In the lower left corner, click ![More icon](/assets/images/docspace/more-icon.png) and open the **Settings** page.

   ![DocSpace Settings](/assets/images/docspace/docspace-settings.png)

2. Go to the **Integration** section.

3. Open the **Plugins** tab.

4. Click the **Upload plugin** button.
