# Creating plugin template

Before starting plugin development, create a plugin template and configure its settings which will be displayed in the DocSpace plugin settings.

1. Install the *@onlyoffice/docspace-plugin-sdk* npm package globally:

   ``` sh
   npm i -g @onlyoffice/docspace-plugin-sdk
   ```

   Now, the **npx** command is available, which will be used to create a plugin.

2. To create a plugin template, run the following command:

   ``` sh
   npx create-docspace-plugin
   ```

3. Configure the plugin in the terminal specifying the following settings in the dialog:

   | Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This field is required.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | Version                | The current plugin version will be displayed in the DocSpace plugin settings. When the page is reloaded, the plugin will be updated to match this version.

   | Description            | The plugin description that will be displayed in the DocSpace plugin settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

   | Homepage               | The plugin homepage. For example, it can be the plugin GitHub repository. This information will be displayed in the DocSpace plugin settings.                                                                                                                                     |

All the specified parameters can be changed later in the *package.json* file.

In the *package.json* file, you can also specify the addresses of the third-party websites to add them to the CSP header and prevent these addresses from being blocked.

You can create a plugin in any project by adding the *@onlyoffice/docspace-plugin-sdk* npm package as the dependency and specifying all the necessary fields in the *package.json* file.
