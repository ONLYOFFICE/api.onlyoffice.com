# Draw.io

A tool for creating diagrams, flowcharts, intelligence maps, business layouts, entity relationships, program blocks, and more.

## Installation

Available by default in the DocSpace Saas solution.

You can enable it following the instructions [here](../developing-plugins/adding-plugin.md#enabling-system-plugins).

## Usage

### Creating a new diagram

To create a new Draw.io diagram:

1. Open the **Documents** section or one of the available rooms.
2. Click **Actions -> More**.
3. Select the **Draw.io** plugin from the appeared menu.
4. Change the file name in a pop-up window and click **Create**. A new *.drawio* file appears in the file list.

To open the created diagram, click the file name or do it via the file context menu -> Actions -> Edit diagram. The file will open in the same tab. To get back to the file list, click "Save&Exit" or "Exit".

If a diagram is opened by a user with the view rights, only the Exit button is available. Any changes made by this user will not be saved.

## Editing an exported diagram

draw.io diagrams can be exported as images. Such images can be re-opened and edited using the plugin.

## How to configure

To start working with the plugin, it is not needed to change the default settings.

In case you want to adjust the plugin settings, go to Settings -> Developer Tools -> Plugins and click on the gear symbol next to the draw.io plugin.
