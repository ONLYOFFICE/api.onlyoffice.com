# reorderRoom

> FolderWrapper reorderRoom(id)

`PUT /api/2.0/files/rooms/{id}/reorder`

Reorder room contents

Renumbers the items directly in a room from 1, without gaps or repeats, and returns the room. The items keep their order. The call moves, renames, copies, or deletes nothing. Files and folders share one sequence. The call does not change the numbers inside subfolders. The call is meant for rooms with `indexing` turned on, where lists follow this order. A room without indexing also accepts it. Requires the room manager role in the room. Other callers get 403. An archived room also returns 403. The call changes data, and you can repeat it. A second call changes nothing. If the room does not exist or was deleted, the call returns 404. If a string `id` points to a storage account that is not connected, the call returns 400.

## Parameters

|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | path | **Integer** (int32) | The room to act on, named by the identifier that `GET api/2.0/files/rooms` reports for it.
