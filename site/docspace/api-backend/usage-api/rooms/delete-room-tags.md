# deleteRoomTags

> FolderWrapper deleteRoomTags(id, BatchTagsRequestDto)

`DELETE /api/2.0/files/rooms/{id}/tags`

Detach tags from a room

Removes tags from a room and returns the room with its other tags. The tags stay in the portal and on other rooms, even a tag that has no rooms left. To delete a tag from the portal, use `DELETE api/2.0/files/tags`. Requires the room manager role in the room, or a DocSpace admin. Other callers get 403. An archived room also returns 403. The call changes data, and you can repeat it with the same body. It skips names that the portal or the room does not have. So check the returned tags to see what changed. An empty list changes nothing. The call returns 400 for a null, blank, or too long name. If the room does not exist, the call returns 404.
