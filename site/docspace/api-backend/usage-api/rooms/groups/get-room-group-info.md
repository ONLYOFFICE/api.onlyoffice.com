# getRoomGroupInfo

> RoomGroupWrapper getRoomGroupInfo(id, includeMembers)

`GET /api/2.0/files/group/{id}`

Get room group info

Returns one room group of the caller with its rooms. Any signed-in user can call it, including a guest. A missing group or a group of another account returns 404, even for a DocSpace admin. The call is read-only. With `includeMembers` set to false, `rooms` is null, but `totalRooms` is still filled. The `rooms` list skips archived rooms, rooms of the other section, and rooms the caller can no longer read. The `totalRooms` count uses the same rule. A skipped room returns after it leaves the archive or the caller gets access again. Rooms stored in the portal come before rooms of third-party storages.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | path | **Integer** (int32) | The room group to act on, identified by the value `GET api/2.0/files/group` reports for it. A group of another account cannot be addressed and reads as missing. | [required] [example: `42`] |
| **includeMembers** | query | **Boolean** | Whether the rooms of the group are listed in the answer: true fills the `rooms` array, false leaves it out and reports only how many there are in `totalRooms`. | [optional] [example: `true`] |
