# deleteRoomLogo

> FolderWrapper deleteRoomLogo(id)

`DELETE /api/2.0/files/rooms/{id}/logo`

Remove a room logo

Removes the uploaded logo of a room and returns the room with empty logo addresses. What the room falls back to is its cover and colour, which the logo only hid: if a cover was set before the logo, it is shown again, and `POST api/2.0/files/rooms/{id}/cover` is what changes it. Nothing else about the room is touched, so membership, tags, links and settings are preserved. A room that has no logo is accepted and answered with 200, and repeating the call is therefore harmless. The caller must be a manager of the room; a member invited even with editing rights is refused, and so is a room in the Archive section. A room that does not exist or was deleted is answered as missing. After the logo is removed a new one can be set again through `POST api/2.0/files/logos` followed by `POST api/2.0/files/rooms/{id}/logo`.

## Parameters
