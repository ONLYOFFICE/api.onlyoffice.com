# aiAttachmentsDeleteMany

> AiSuccessResponse aiAttachmentsDeleteMany(request\_body)

`DELETE /api/2.0/ai/attachments/delete-many`

Delete many

Permanently deletes several attachments in one round trip. `ids` is optional and an absent value is treated as an empty list, so a malformed request quietly deletes nothing instead of failing. IDs that do not exist are skipped without being reported, so the answer confirms only that the call was accepted. The deletions cannot be undone.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **request\_body** | body | **List** | The IDs of the attachments to delete, as a bare JSON array of strings. | [required] |
