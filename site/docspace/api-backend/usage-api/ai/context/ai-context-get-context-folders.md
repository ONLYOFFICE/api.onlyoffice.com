`GET /api/2.0/ai/context/get-context-folders`

Get context folders

Lists the Instructions rooms the caller can connect to a chat as context, grouped under the account they belong to (`docspace` for this portal). Only a room the caller can read that holds at least one skill is listed: one without skills would connect nothing. An empty list means there is nothing to connect. At most 1000 Instructions rooms are read; any beyond them are left out without a signal. Read the skills of one room with `GET api/2.0/ai/context/get-room-skills`. This is a read-only operation.
