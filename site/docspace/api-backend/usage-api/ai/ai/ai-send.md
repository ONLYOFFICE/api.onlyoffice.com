# aiSend

> AiThreadMessageLike aiSend(AiSendRequest)

`POST /api/2.0/ai/ai/send`

Run an AI action

Runs one AI action and returns the whole answer as a single JSON document. The model is the profile bound to `actionType`, falling back to the `Default` assignment slot, so this operation accepts no `profileId` of its own. Nothing is persisted - no thread is opened, no message is stored and no title is generated - which makes it the one to use for a stand-alone completion rather than for a conversation. `entityId` and `contextEntityId` set the scope of the round, which decides the workspace context and the custom MCP servers it may reach. For a conversation that keeps its history, use `POST api/2.0/ai/ai/send-with-stream` instead.
