> AiAiSettingsWrapper aiSettingsGet()

`GET /api/2.0/ai/config`

Get AI settings

Reports the portal's AI configuration and whether AI is usable at all, which is the first call a client makes before offering any AI feature. It takes no parameters and is proxied unchanged to the DocSpace AI service, so the answer is that service's settings payload. Among other things it says whether the portal runs on the central AI gateway, which decides whether provider profiles can be edited here at all. This is a read-only operation.

## Parameters
This endpoint does not need any parameter.
