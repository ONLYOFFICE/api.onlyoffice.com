# aiSettingsSetVectorization

> AiVectorizationSettingsWrapper aiSettingsSetVectorization(request\_body)

`PUT /api/2.0/ai/config/vectorization`

Update vectorization settings

Replaces the portal's vectorization settings and returns the stored result. The body is proxied unchanged to the DocSpace AI service, which validates it, so a rejected value is reported with that service's own verdict rather than being checked here. Changing the embedding provider does not re-index anything already indexed - start that separately with `POST api/2.0/ai/vectorization/tasks`. This is a portal-wide setting and requires the permissions the AI service demands for it.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **request\_body** | body | **Map** | The portal's vectorization settings, proxied unchanged to the DocSpace AI service, which owns and validates the shape. Read the current one with `GET api/2.0/ai/config/vectorization` and send it back changed. | [required] |
