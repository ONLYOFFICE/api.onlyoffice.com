# aiPreferencesSetDeepMode

> AiSuccessResponse aiPreferencesSetDeepMode(AiPreferencesSetDeepModeRequest)

`PUT /api/2.0/ai/preferences/set-deep-mode`

Set deep mode

Stores the deep-mode toggle of a scope. `false` stores the `off` depth; `true` keeps the depth already stored and falls back to the default depth (`medium`) when none is. `value` has to be a real boolean: a string, a number or an absent value is rejected rather than coerced, so the string false cannot silently switch the setting on and an empty request cannot silently switch it off. `entityId` picks a room and omitting it writes the portal-wide preference. It is idempotent, so there is no need to read the current value first.
