# aiPromptsDelete

> AiSuccessResponse aiPromptsDelete(body)

`DELETE /api/2.0/ai/prompts/delete`

Delete a saved prompt

Deletes one saved prompt from the caller's library. The ID may be sent in the body or as a query parameter, and it is required. An ID that does not exist, or that belongs to another user, is not reported: the call answers success without deleting anything. The deletion is permanent.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **body** | body | **String** | The ID of the prompt to delete, as a bare JSON string. | [required] |
