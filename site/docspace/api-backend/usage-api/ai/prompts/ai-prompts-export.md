# aiPromptsExport

> AiPromptBundle aiPromptsExport()

`GET /api/2.0/ai/prompts/export`

Export the prompt library

Builds a versioned bundle of every prompt and folder in the caller's library and returns it, with no parameters. The bundle is self-contained: it carries its own format version so an older export can still be read back, and it is the input `POST api/2.0/ai/prompts/import-bundle` expects. This is also the only way to read the whole library at once, since listing is folder-scoped. Nothing is changed by the call.

## Parameters
This endpoint does not need any parameter.
