# aiPromptsCreateFolder

> AiFolderMutationResult aiPromptsCreateFolder(body)

`POST /api/2.0/ai/prompts/create-folder`

Create folder

Creates a folder in the caller's prompt library and returns it. The name has to be non-empty and unique across that library. Folders do not nest: there is one flat level, so a folder cannot be created inside another. The answer carries the folder ID to use as `folderId` when saving or moving prompts.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **body** | body | **String** | The name of the folder to create, as a bare JSON string. | [required] |
