`GET /api/2.0/ai/assignments/resolve-for-action`

Resolve for action

Returns the profile that will serve one AI action, falling back to the `Default` slot when the action has no profile of its own. `actionType` is required and has to be one of the known actions - an unknown or misspelled value is rejected rather than resolved to the default. `entityId` narrows the lookup to a room, and a room with no assignment of its own degrades to the portal-wide one. This fails when neither slot is set or the bound profile is gone, so use `GET api/2.0/ai/assignments/try-resolve-for-action` when an unconfigured portal should answer empty instead.

## Parameters

| **entityId** | query | **String** | The DocSpace entity the request is scoped to - the room, folder or agent workspace the chat is invoked from. Omit for the portal-wide scope. | [optional] [example: `1234`] |
