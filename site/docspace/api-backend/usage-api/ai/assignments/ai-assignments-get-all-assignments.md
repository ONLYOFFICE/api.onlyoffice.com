# aiAssignmentsGetAllAssignments

> Map aiAssignmentsGetAllAssignments(entityId)

`GET /api/2.0/ai/assignments/get-all-assignments`

Get all assignments

Returns every action-to-profile binding of a scope as one map, which is what a settings screen loads. `entityId` narrows it to a room and has to name one the caller can open; a room that is not an agent room degrades to the portal-wide set rather than answering empty, and omitting the parameter reads the portal-wide set directly. Actions with no binding are simply absent from the map. The `Default` slot is reported as an entry of its own rather than being folded into the others.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **entityId** | query | **String** | The DocSpace entity the request is scoped to - the room, folder or agent workspace the chat is invoked from. Omit for the portal-wide scope. | [optional] [example: `1234`] |

## Responses

| Status code | Description | Type | Response headers |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **200** | The scope's bindings as a map of action type to profile ID. An action with no binding is absent. | **Map** | - |
| **401** | Missing `asc_auth_key` cookie or `Authorization` header. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **403** | AI is disabled for this portal, the caller is a guest, or the room named by `entityId` is one the caller cannot open. Relayed from the DocSpace AI service or the Files API. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **404** | The referenced object does not exist: an unknown or deleted room named by `entityId`, or an object the caller cannot read - for those the two cases are deliberately indistinguishable. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **500** | Unhandled failure. The reason is logged server-side and never echoed back. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
