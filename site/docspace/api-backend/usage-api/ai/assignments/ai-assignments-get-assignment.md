# aiAssignmentsGetAssignment

> String aiAssignmentsGetAssignment(actionType)

`GET /api/2.0/ai/assignments/get-assignment`

Get assignment

Returns the profile bound to one AI action, without applying the `Default` fallback - an empty answer means this action has no profile of its own, not that nothing is configured. `actionType` is required and is read from the query. Use `GET api/2.0/ai/assignments/resolve-for-action` to learn which profile would actually serve the action. This reads the portal-wide binding and accepts no `entityId`.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **actionType** | query | **String** | The AI action the request applies to - one of Default, Chat, Code, Summarization, Translation, TextAnalyze, ImageGeneration, OCR, Vision. | [required] [example: `Chat`] |
