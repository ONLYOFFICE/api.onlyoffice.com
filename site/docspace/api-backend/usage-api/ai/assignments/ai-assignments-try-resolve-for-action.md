`GET /api/2.0/ai/assignments/try-resolve-for-action`

Try resolve for action

Returns the profile that will serve one AI action, exactly as `GET api/2.0/ai/assignments/resolve-for-action` does, but answers with an empty result rather than failing when nothing is configured. `actionType` is required and is validated the same way, and `entityId` narrows the lookup to a room. This is the operation to call when the absence of a profile is a normal state to render - a settings screen, or a feature that hides itself. Both operations are read-only.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **actionType** | query | **String** | The AI action the request applies to - one of Default, Chat, Code, Summarization, Translation, TextAnalyze, ImageGeneration, OCR, Vision. | [required] [example: `Chat`] |
| **entityId** | query | **String** | The DocSpace entity the request is scoped to - the room, folder or agent workspace the chat is invoked from. Omit for the portal-wide scope. | [optional] [example: `1234`] |
