# aiWebSearchPassthroughContents

> Map aiWebSearchPassthroughContents(request\_body)

`POST /api/2.0/ai/websearch/v1/contents`

Web page contents passthrough

Fetches the contents of web pages on behalf of the document editor's AI plugin, against the portal's active web-search provider, exactly as the search passthrough does — including the `entityId` / `entityKind` billing attribution. The portal-wide configuration is used and a portal without one answers 404. The provider's status, body and content type are relayed verbatim, so its 429 and its failures surface unchanged. This is the follow-up to `POST api/2.0/ai/websearch/v1/search`, which returns the results whose contents this operation retrieves.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **request\_body** | body | **Map** | A page-contents request in the shape the portal's active web-search provider expects, forwarded to it unchanged. The endpoint and the key come from the stored configuration. | [required] |

## Responses
