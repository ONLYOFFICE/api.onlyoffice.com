# aiWebSearchGetActiveConfig

> AiWebSearchConfig aiWebSearchGetActiveConfig(entityId)

`GET /api/2.0/ai/web-search/get-active-config`

Get active config

Returns the web-search configuration in force for a scope - the provider, its endpoint and its settings. `entityId` picks a room and has to name one the caller can open; omitting it reads the portal-wide configuration, and a room with none of its own falls back to that. An unconfigured scope answers an empty result rather than 404. The provider key is not part of the answer, so a client cannot read it back after storing it.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **entityId** | query | **String** | The DocSpace entity the request is scoped to - the room, folder or agent workspace the chat is invoked from. Omit for the portal-wide scope. | [optional] [example: `1234`] |

## Responses

| Status code | Description | Type | Response headers |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **200** | The configuration in force for the scope, without the provider key, or an empty result when web search is not configured. | [**AiWebSearchConfig**](../../models/ai-web-search-config.md) | - |
| **400** | `entityId` is not a string. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **401** | Missing `asc_auth_key` cookie or `Authorization` header. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **403** | AI is disabled for this portal, or the caller is a guest. Relayed from the DocSpace AI service. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **404** | The referenced object does not exist, or the caller cannot access it - the two are deliberately indistinguishable, so a room the caller may not open answers 404 rather than 403. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **500** | Unhandled failure. The reason is logged server-side and never echoed back. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
