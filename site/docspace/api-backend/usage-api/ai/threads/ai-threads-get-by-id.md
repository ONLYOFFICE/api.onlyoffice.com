# aiThreadsGetById

> AiThread aiThreadsGetById(threadId)

`GET /api/2.0/ai/threads/get-by-id`

Get a chat thread

Returns one thread by its ID, without its messages - read those with `GET api/2.0/ai/threads/read-messages`. `threadId` is required and an unknown one answers 404, so the result is never an empty body. The answer carries the thread's title, its model binding and its last-edit date. This is a read-only operation and does not bump that date.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **threadId** | query | **String** | The chat thread identifier. | [required] [example: `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`] |
