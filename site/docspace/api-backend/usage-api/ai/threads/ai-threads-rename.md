# aiThreadsRename

> AiSuccessResponse aiThreadsRename(aiThreadsRename\_request)

`PUT /api/2.0/ai/threads/rename`

Rename a chat thread

Replaces a thread's title with the one supplied and bumps its last-edit date. Both `threadId` and a title with at least one non-whitespace character are required - a blank title is rejected rather than silently stored, so a thread cannot end up nameless. The answer only confirms the write. To have the model produce a title instead of supplying one, use `POST api/2.0/ai/threads/regenerate-title`.
