# aiAgentsGet

> aiAgentsGet_200_response aiAgentsGet(id)

`GET /api/2.0/ai/agents/{id}`

Get an agent

Returns one AI agent room, enriched with the `profileId` currently bound to it so an edit form can prefill its model selector. The ID is the room's integer identifier, and a non-integer value is refused rather than passed on to fail opaquely upstream. The binding lives in an assignment rather than on the room, so it is looked up separately: a missing or unreadable assignment simply leaves `profileId` out of the answer instead of failing the call. The standing instruction comes back on the room as `chatSettings.prompt`.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | path | **String** | The agent identifier. | [required] [example: `1234`] |
