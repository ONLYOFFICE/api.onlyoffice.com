# aiAgentsUpdate

> AiFolderIntegerWrapper aiAgentsUpdate(id, aiAgentsUpdate\_request)

`PUT /api/2.0/ai/agents/{id}`

Update an agent

Changes an AI agent room - its title, tags or standing instruction - and optionally rebinds its model. The ID has to be the room's integer identifier. `profileId` is not part of the room contract: it is taken out of the forwarded body and applied afterwards as the agent's assignment, and it has to be a UUID naming an existing chat-capable profile. An instruction sent as `chatSettings.prompt` has its markup stripped, as on create; note that when `chatSettings` is present the upstream service still requires the rest of that object to be valid, so send it whole.

## Parameters
