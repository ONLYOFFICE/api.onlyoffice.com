# aiToolsSetDisabled

> AiSuccessResponse aiToolsSetDisabled(aiToolsSetDisabled\_request)

`PUT /api/2.0/ai/tools/set-disabled`

Set disabled

Switches off the listed tools of one server type in the scope, so the model is no longer offered them. `serverType` has to be a key the round's tool filter actually matches - a host-configured system server, one of the two DocSpace integration groups, web search, image generation, or one of the scope's registered custom servers - and an unknown value is rejected with the list of valid ones in the message, rather than stored and silently ignored. `toolNames` replaces the previous selection for that server type, so send the full list and pass an empty one to switch everything back on. `entityId` has to name a room the caller can open.

## Parameters

## Responses

| Status code | Description | Type | Response headers |

| **404** | The referenced object does not exist, or the caller cannot access it - the two are deliberately indistinguishable, so a room the caller may not open answers 404 rather than 403. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
