> AiSuccessResponse aiToolsRemoveCustomServer(AiToolsRemoveCustomServerRequest)

`DELETE /api/2.0/ai/tools/remove-custom-server`

Remove custom server

Unregisters a custom MCP server from the scope, so the model is no longer offered its tools. The name is required and may be sent in the body or as a query parameter, and `entityId` has to name a room the caller can open. A name that is not registered is not reported: the call answers success without removing anything. The server itself is untouched - only this portal's registration is dropped.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **AiToolsRemoveCustomServerRequest** | body | [**AiToolsRemoveCustomServerRequest**](../../models/ai-tools-remove-custom-server-request.md) |  | [required] |

## Responses

| Status code | Description | Type | Response headers |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **200** | Confirms the request was accepted, whether or not a registration was removed. | [**AiSuccessResponse**](../../models/ai-success-response.md) | - |
| **400** | The server name is missing. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **401** | Missing `asc_auth_key` cookie or `Authorization` header. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **403** | AI is disabled for this portal, the caller is a guest, or the room named by `entityId` is one the caller cannot open. Relayed from the DocSpace AI service or the Files API. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **404** | The referenced object does not exist: an unknown or deleted room named by `entityId`, or an object the caller cannot read - for those the two cases are deliberately indistinguishable. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
| **413** | The request body is larger than 100 KB, the JSON parser's limit on this route. | [**AiErrorResponse**](../../models/ai-error-response.md) | - |
