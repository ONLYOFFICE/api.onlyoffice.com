# aiProfilesGetById

> aiProfilesGetById_200_response aiProfilesGetById(id)

`GET /api/2.0/ai/profiles/get-by-id`

Get a provider profile

Returns one AI provider profile by its ID, with its secrets stripped: neither the API key nor the custom headers are ever sent back, on any portal. The ID is required and is read from the query, and an unknown one answers 404. The `baseUrl` in the answer is the one that was stored, not the internal gateway address a round actually dials, so it cannot be used to reach the provider directly. Use `GET api/2.0/ai/profiles/list` to enumerate profiles instead of reading them one by one.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | query | **String** | The AI provider profile identifier. | [required] [example: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`] |
