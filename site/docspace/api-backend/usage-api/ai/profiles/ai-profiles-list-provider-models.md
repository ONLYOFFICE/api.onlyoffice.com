# aiProfilesListProviderModels

> List aiProfilesListProviderModels(aiProfilesListProviderModels\_request)

`POST /api/2.0/ai/profiles/list-provider-models`

List provider models

Lists the models an endpoint offers for credentials supplied in the request, before any profile exists - this is what a provider-setup form calls to fill its model picker. `providerType` and `baseUrl` are both required, and a 400 for either names the offending input in a `field` member so the form can highlight it; a `baseUrl` pointing at a private network address is refused as well. For `providerType: onlyoffice` the answer comes from the portal gateway's catalogue, which carries richer capability data than the provider's own listing and matches what `GET api/2.0/ai/profiles/list` reports; a portal without that gateway falls back to asking the provider. A provider that is unreachable or broken is reported as 502, and one that rejects the key as 400.
