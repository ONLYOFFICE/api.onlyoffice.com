# aiProfilesDelete

> AiSuccessResponse aiProfilesDelete(body)

`DELETE /api/2.0/ai/profiles/delete`

Delete a provider profile

Deletes an AI provider profile and cleans up every assignment pointing at it: the `Default` slot moves to the first remaining profile and the other slots are left unbound. The ID is required and may be sent in the body or as a query parameter. An unknown ID is not reported - the call answers success without deleting anything. Threads already bound to the profile keep the stored reference, so a round on such a thread falls back to whatever the scope resolves to.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **body** | body | **String** | The ID of the profile to delete, as a bare JSON string. | [required] |
