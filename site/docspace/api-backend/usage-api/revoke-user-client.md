`DELETE /api/2.0/oauth2/clients/{clientId}/revoke`

Revoke client consent

Revokes the calling user's own consent for one client and answers 200 with an empty body. It touches only the caller's grant: other users keep their consents and the client itself stays registered. Guests may call it as well as users and administrators, because it can never reach anyone else's data. The revocation is carried out by the authorization service over gRPC, so a service that reports nothing was revoked produces 400 and a service that cannot be reached produces 503. Once it succeeds the user has to authorize the client again before it can act on their behalf.
