# getClientInfo

> ClientInfoResponse getClientInfo(clientId)

`GET /api/2.0/oauth2/clients/{clientId}/info`

Get client info

Retrieves the detailed information for a client with the ID specified in the request. It returns the consent-facing subset of the client - name, description, logo, the website, terms and policy URLs, authentication methods and scopes - and deliberately omits the secret, the redirect URIs and the allowed origins, which is what makes it safe to render on a consent screen. An administrator sees any client of the tenant, a plain user only the clients they created, and a guest none of them. A client the caller may not see is reported as 404, exactly like an unknown one.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **clientId** | path | **String** | ID of the client to retrieve | [required] [example: `6c7cf17b-1bd3-47d5-94c6-be2d3570e168`] [minLength: 1] |
