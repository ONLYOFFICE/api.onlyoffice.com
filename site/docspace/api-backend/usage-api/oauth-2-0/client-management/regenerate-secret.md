# regenerateSecret

> ClientSecretResponse regenerateSecret(clientId)

`PATCH /api/2.0/oauth2/clients/{clientId}/regenerate`

Regenerate client secret

Issues a new secret for the client and returns it. The previous secret stops working as soon as this call succeeds, there is no grace period and no way to recover it, so every deployed copy of the client has to be updated with the value returned here. An administrator may do this for any client of the tenant, a plain user only for the clients they created. Tokens already issued to the client keep working; only future client authentication is affected. The response carries the new secret and nothing else.

## Parameters
