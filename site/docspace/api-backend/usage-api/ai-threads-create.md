`POST /api/2.0/ai/threads/create`

Create a chat thread

Creates a chat thread with a title supplied by the caller and returns it. A scoped thread requires that `entityId` names a room the caller can open, and a model has to resolve for the scope - an explicit `profileId`, or the room's `Chat` assignment - otherwise there is nothing to run the thread against and the call answers 404. In an agent room the agent's own assignment overrides any `profileId` sent with the request, so a thread there always starts on the agent's model. Use `POST api/2.0/ai/threads/open-or-create` instead when the title should be generated from the first user message.
