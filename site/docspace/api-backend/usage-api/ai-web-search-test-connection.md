> aiProfilesTestConnection_200_response aiWebSearchTestConnection(AiWebSearchConfig)

`POST /api/2.0/ai/web-search/test-connection`

Test a web-search provider

Probes a web-search configuration against the live provider and reports the outcome, storing nothing - this is what a Test button calls so that a failure commits no state. The configuration is taken from the request rather than from storage, so credentials that were never saved can be checked. A `baseUrl` pointing at a private network address is refused before any request leaves the portal. The verdict is carried in the body rather than in the status, so a failed probe still answers 200 and the caller has to read the payload.
