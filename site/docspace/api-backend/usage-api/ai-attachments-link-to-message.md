`POST /api/2.0/ai/attachments/link-to-message`

Link to message

Binds draft attachments to the chat message that owns them, after that message has been persisted, so that deleting the message removes them too. All three of `ids`, `messageId` and `threadId` are required, and the references are verified rather than trusted: an unknown message answers 404, a message that belongs to a different thread answers 400, and attachments that no longer exist answer 404 naming each missing ID. That verification exists because the underlying binding call skips unknown IDs silently, which used to report success for a link that had not happened. Drafts stay unbound until this succeeds.
