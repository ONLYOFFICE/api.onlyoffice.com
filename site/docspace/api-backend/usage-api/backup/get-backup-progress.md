# getBackupProgress

> BackupProgressWrapper getBackupProgress(dump)

`GET /api/2.0/backup/getbackupprogress`

Get the backup progress

Returns the state of the backup job of the portal. A portal has at most one backup job. Requires the EditPortalSettings permission, which the portal owner and DocSpace admins have. Other callers get 403. With `dump`, a caller without the space access permission also gets 403. The call is read-only. This is the call to poll after `POST api/2.0/backup/startbackup`. Repeat it until `isCompleted` is true. If there is no job, the call returns 200 without the `response` field.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **dump** | query | **Boolean** | Applies the operation to the whole server rather than to the current portal, which requires the space access permission and works on a standalone installation only. Server-wide backups and schedules are kept apart from the ones of a portal, so the two values address different data. | [optional] [example: `false`] |
