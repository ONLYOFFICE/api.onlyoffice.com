`GET /api/2.0/settings/logo`

Get a portal logo

Returns the absolute URL of the portal's current logo image, already resolved against the active white-label branding. Requires an authenticated session; every role, including Guest, can read it. This is a read-only, idempotent call. The response supports conditional requests: send the standard If-Modified-Since header with the previous `lastModified` value, and an unchanged response comes back empty instead of resending the same URL. The URL points at whatever image is currently configured, including the default DocSpace logo when no custom branding has been set.

## Parameters
This endpoint does not need any parameter.
