`DELETE /api/2.0/ai/prompts/delete-folder`

Delete folder

Deletes a folder together with every prompt inside it, permanently. The ID is required and may be sent in the body or as a query parameter. Unlike deleting a prompt, this checks first: a folder that does not exist, and one that belongs to another user, both answer 404 - the two cases are deliberately indistinguishable, so a foreign folder cannot be probed. Move the prompts out with `PUT api/2.0/ai/prompts/move` first if they should survive.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **body** | body | **String** | The ID of the folder to delete, as a bare JSON string. | [required] |
