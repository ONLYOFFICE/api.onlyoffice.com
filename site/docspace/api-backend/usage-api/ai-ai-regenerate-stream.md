`POST /api/2.0/ai/ai/regenerate-stream`

Regenerate stream

Re-rolls the last assistant reply of an existing thread: every message after the last user message - the previous reply and any tool-call hops - is dropped, and a fresh reply is streamed as newline-delimited `ChatEvent` objects against the unchanged prompt. The thread has to exist already, `threadId` is required, and no title is generated. The dropped messages are gone for good, so this is a destructive operation on the thread's tail rather than a retry that keeps both answers. Unlike `send-with-stream` the profile is not verified before the stream opens, so an unusable model surfaces as an error frame inside the 200 rather than as a 4xx.
