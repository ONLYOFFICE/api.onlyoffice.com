# getEditHistory

> EditHistoryArrayWrapper getEditHistory(fileId)

`GET /api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/edit/history`

Get version history

Returns the editing revisions of a file, oldest first. The list has only the versions that a person saved, without the autosaves of editing sessions. That is how it differs from `GET api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/history`. Requires the right to read the file history, which editing access gives. Other callers get 403, including read-only and commenting access. An anonymous caller and a file in a third-party storage also get 403. The call is read-only. If no file has this id, the call returns 404. To show the changes of an entry, use `GET api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/edit/diff`. To restore an entry, use `POST api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/restoreversion`.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **fileId** | path | **Integer** (int32) | The file the operation addresses. Take the identifier from a listing such as `GET api/2.0/files/{folderId}`: a file stored on the portal is numbered, while a file in a connected third-party account is named by an opaque string. | [required] [example: `10`] |
