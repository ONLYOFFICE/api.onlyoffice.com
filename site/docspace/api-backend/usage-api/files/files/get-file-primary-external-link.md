# getFilePrimaryExternalLink

> FileShareWrapper getFilePrimaryExternalLink(id, count, startIndex)

`GET /api/2.0/files/file/{id}/link`

Get the file primary external link

Returns the primary external link of a file, and creates it on the first call if the file has none. The new link has read rights, no password, and no expiration date. For a PDF form in a form-filling room, the call returns the link of the room. Requires the right to share the file, which its author and a room manager have. Other callers get 403. An anonymous caller gets 401. The call changes data only on the first call, and later calls return the same link. If the primary link was revoked, the call returns 404 and does not create it again. The address is in `sharedTo.shareLink`. If `count` is outside its allowed range, the call returns 400. To list all links of the file, use `GET api/2.0/files/file/{id}/links`.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | path | **Integer** (int32) | The file the operation addresses. Take the identifier from a listing such as `GET api/2.0/files/{folderId}`: a file stored on the portal is numbered, while a file in a connected third-party account is named by an opaque string. | [required] [example: `10`] |
| **count** | query | **Integer** (int32) | How many entries at most to answer with, in the operations of this file that return a list; an operation that answers with a single object is not affected by it. | [optional] [example: `25`] [min: 1] [max: 100] |
| **startIndex** | query | **Integer** (int32) | How many entries of such a list to skip before answering, used together with `count` to walk through it page by page. | [optional] [example: `0`] |
