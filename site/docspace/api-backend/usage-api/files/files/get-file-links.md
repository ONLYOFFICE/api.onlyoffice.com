# getFileLinks

> FileShareArrayWrapper getFileLinks(id, count, startIndex)

`GET /api/2.0/files/file/{id}/links`

Get file external links

Returns the external links of a file. Requires read access to the file. Other callers get 403. A caller who cannot share the file gets no links, except in a public room, where reading links is enough. The call is read-only. The response headers carry the total number of links, not the body. A file without links returns an empty list. The list includes the primary link after `GET api/2.0/files/file/{id}/link` creates it. For a PDF form in a form-filling room, the call adds the link of the room at the end. If no file has this id, the call returns 404. If `count` is outside its allowed range, the call returns 400. To change or revoke a link, use `PUT api/2.0/files/file/{id}/links` with its id.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | path | **Integer** (int32) | The file the operation addresses. Take the identifier from a listing such as `GET api/2.0/files/{folderId}`: a file stored on the portal is numbered, while a file in a connected third-party account is named by an opaque string. | [required] [example: `10`] |
| **count** | query | **Integer** (int32) | How many entries at most to answer with, in the operations of this file that return a list; an operation that answers with a single object is not affected by it. | [optional] [example: `25`] [min: 1] [max: 100] |
| **startIndex** | query | **Integer** (int32) | How many entries of such a list to skip before answering, used together with `count` to walk through it page by page. | [optional] [example: `0`] |
