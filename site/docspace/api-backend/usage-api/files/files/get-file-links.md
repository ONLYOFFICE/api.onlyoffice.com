# getFileLinks

> FileShareArrayWrapper getFileLinks(id, count, startIndex)

`GET /api/2.0/files/file/{id}/links`

Get file external links

Lists the external links of a file, each with its identifier, title, address, rights, expiration date and download restriction. `startIndex` and `count` page through the list, and the total number of links is reported in the response headers rather than in the body. A file that has never been shared by link answers with an empty list; the primary link is part of this list once it exists, and it is the only one that is created on demand, by `GET api/2.0/files/file/{id}/link`. For a PDF form kept in a form-filling room the link of the room is appended to the answer, because that is the address through which the form is filled out. The caller needs the right to share the file, which its creator, the room admin and a DocSpace admin acting as room manager have; a caller without access to the file is refused and an anonymous caller is rejected. The operation is read-only. Take an identifier from here to `PUT api/2.0/files/file/{id}/links` to change or remove that link.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | path | **Integer** (int32) | The file the operation addresses. Take the identifier from a listing such as `GET api/2.0/files/{folderId}`: a file stored on the portal is numbered, while a file in a connected third-party account is named by an opaque string. | [required] [example: `10`] |
| **count** | query | **Integer** (int32) | How many entries at most to answer with, in the operations of this file that return a list; an operation that answers with a single object is not affected by it. | [optional] [example: `25`] [min: 1] [max: 100] |
| **startIndex** | query | **Integer** (int32) | How many entries of such a list to skip before answering, used together with `count` to walk through it page by page. | [optional] [example: `0`] |
