# getFolderPath

> FileEntryBaseArrayWrapper getFolderPath(folderId)

`GET /api/2.0/files/folder/{folderId}/path`

Get the folder path

Returns the chain of folders from the section root down to the given folder. The folder itself is the last entry. Use it for a breadcrumb trail or to find the section of a folder. Requires read access to the folder. Other callers get 403. The call is read-only. The chain has only the folders that the caller can see. So a user with access to a deep folder gets a shorter chain than the room manager. The call returns the whole chain, without paging. If the folder does not exist, the call returns 404. To list the contents of a folder, use `GET api/2.0/files/{folderId}`.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **folderId** | path | **Integer** (int32) | The folder the operation acts on. Take the identifier from a listing such as `GET api/2.0/files/@root` or `GET api/2.0/files/{folderId}`: a folder stored in the portal is numbered, while a folder in a connected third-party account is named by an opaque string. | [required] [example: `1`] |
