> deleteTemplate(templateId)

`DELETE /api/2.0/files/metadata/templates/{templateId}`

Delete a metadata template

Deletes a metadata template together with its fields, its assignments and every value written for its fields on any file, folder or room of the portal. Only a DocSpace admin can delete templates. The deletion is irreversible and there is no confirmation: the affected entries lose the template at once, their search documents are rebuilt and the clients viewing them are told to refresh. A template that does not exist, or was already deleted, is answered with 404. To take the template off a single entry and keep it for the others use `DELETE api/2.0/files/metadata/file/{fileId}/templates/{templateId}` instead.
