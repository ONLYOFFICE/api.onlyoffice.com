`DELETE /api/2.0/ai/assignments/unassign`

Clear an action's profile

Clears the portal-wide binding of one AI action, after which the action falls back to the `Default` slot. `actionType` is required and may be sent in the body or as a query parameter. An action whose slot is already empty is not reported as an error - the call answers success either way, so it is safe to repeat. Clearing `Default` itself leaves the actions that relied on it unresolvable.

## Parameters
