`POST /api/2.0/ai/attachments/save-files-many`

Save files many

Stores several file attachments as drafts in one round trip and returns them in the order they were sent. Each entry is validated exactly as the single-file operation validates its `input`, and the first bad one rejects the whole batch with its index named in the message - nothing is stored. `inputs` has to be present and an array: an absent or null value is a malformed request rather than an empty batch, and only an explicit empty array means no files. Follow up with `POST api/2.0/ai/attachments/link-to-message` to bind the drafts to a message.
