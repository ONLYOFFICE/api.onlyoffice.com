# Java Spring example

## Overview

This example will help you integrate ONLYOFFICE Docs into your web application written in Java with Spring Boot.

Spring Boot has a lot of functionality, but its most significant features are: dependency management, auto-configuration, and built-in servlet containers.

> It is intended for testing purposes and demonstrating functionality of the editors. **DO NOT** use this integration example on your own server without proper code modifications. In case you enabled the test example, disable it before going for production.

## Important security info

Please keep in mind the following security aspects when you are using test examples:

- There is no protection of the storage from unauthorized access since there is no need for authorization.
- There are no checks against parameter substitution in links, since the parameters are generated by the code according to the pre-arranged scripts.
- There are no data checks in requests of saving the file after editing, since each test example is intended for requests only from ONLYOFFICE Docs.
- There are no prohibitions on using test examples from other sites, since they are intended to interact with ONLYOFFICE Docs from another domain.

## For Windows

### Step 1. Install ONLYOFFICE Docs

Download and install ONLYOFFICE Docs (packaged as Document Server):

[Get ONLYOFFICE Docs](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-docs.aspx?from=api#docs-developer)

See the detailed guide to learn how to install ONLYOFFICE Docs [for Windows](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-install-windows.aspx?from=api_java_example).

### Step 2. Download the Java code for the editors integration

Download the [Java-Spring example](./language-specific-samples.md) from our site.

To connect the editors to your website, specify the path to the editors installation and the path to the storage folder in the *src/main/resources/application.properties* file:

``` ini
files.storage=
server.port=port
files.docservice.url.site=https://documentserver/
```

where the **documentserver** is the name of the server with the ONLYOFFICE Docs installed, **port** is any available port and **files.storage** is the path where files will be created and stored (in the project folder by default).
You can set an absolute path. For example, *D:\\\folder*. Please note that on Windows OS the double backslash must be used as a separator.

If you want to experiment with the editor configuration, modify the [parameters](../../docs/docs-api/usage-api/advanced-parameters.md) in the *src/main/webapp/editor.jsp* file.

### Step 3. Install the prerequisites

To run the Java-Spring example code, install the Java version 11 appropriate for your OS and framework **Apache Maven**:

- **Java** (download from [the Oracle official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11));
- **Apache Maven** (download from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)).

### Step 4. Set environment variables

1. After you have installed Java on Windows, set the **JAVA\_HOME** environment variable to point to the Java installation directory.

   Find out where Java is installed. If you didn't change the path during installation, it will be something like this:

   ``` sh
   C:\Program Files\Java\jdk11
   ```

   In **Windows 7**, right click **My Computer** and select **Properties**, then click **Advanced**.

   In **Windows 8**, go to **Control Panel** and select **System**, then click **Advanced System Settings**.

   Click the **Environment Variables** button.

   Under **System Variables**, click **New**.

   In the **Variable Name** field, enter **JAVA\_HOME** if you installed the **JDK** (Java Development Kit) or **JRE\_HOME** if you installed the **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment).

   In the **Variable Value** field, enter your **JDK** or **JRE** installation path, for example *C:\Program Files\Java\jdk11*.

   Check if the variable created successfully by **echo** command in the **Command Prompt**:

   ``` sh
   echo %JAVA_HOME%
   ```

2. Set the **MAVEN_HOME** environment variable:

   Unzip the downloaded archive with Maven to any directory. It will be something like this:

   ``` sh
   C:\apache-maven-3.8.1
   ```

   In **Windows 7**, right click **My Computer** and select **Properties**, then click **Advanced**.

   In **Windows 8**, go to **Control Panel** and select **System**, then click **Advanced System Settings**.

   Click the **Environment Variables** button.

   Under **System Variables**, click **New**.

   In the **Variable Name** field, enter **MAVEN_HOME**.

   In the **Variable Value** field, enter your **JDK** or **JRE** installation path, for example *C:\apache-maven-3.8.1*.

   In the system variables, find **PATH**, click the **Edit...** button. In the **Edit environment variable** dialog, click the **New** button and add *C:\apache-maven-3.8.1\bin* to the **PATH** system variable.

   Check if the variable created successfully by **echo** command in the **Command Prompt**:

   ``` sh
   echo %MAVEN_HOME%
   ```

### Step 5 . Start application with Maven

1. Open a console and go to the *java-spring* folder using the **cd** command:

   ``` sh
   cd C:\Program Files\document-server-integration\web\documentserver-example\java-spring
   ```

2. In the open console, enter the following commands:

   ``` sh
   mvn clean
   mvn package
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Open your browser using **server.address** and **server.port**:

   ``` sh
   http://server.address:server.port/
   ```

### Step 6. Check accessibility

In case the example and ONLYOFFICE Docs are installed on different computers, make sure that your server with the example installed has access to the ONLYOFFICE Docs with the address which you specify instead of **documentserver** in the configuration files. Make sure that the ONLYOFFICE Docs in its turn has access to the server with the example installed with the address which you specify instead of **example.com** in the configuration files.
